    entry = memory.share_learning(
        title="Discord Webhook Solution - Post Without Long-Running Bot",
        content="""# Discord Webhook Posting Solution

**Problem:** Discord bot is long-running service - cannot post-and-exit
**Solution:** Use Discord webhooks for one-shot posting!

## Why Webhooks:
- Bot runs continuously (blocks)
- Webhook posts and exits (perfect for devlogs)
- No bot token needed (just webhook URL)
- Simple 2-3 hour implementation

## Setup:
1. Discord â†’ Server Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
2. Create New Webhook
3. Copy URL
4. Use in Python script

## Code:
```python
import requests

webhook_url = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
payload = {"content": devlog_content, "username": "Agent Bot"}
requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
```

## Batch Posting:
```bash
python tools/batch_post_devlogs.py
# Posts all devlogs automatically
```

**Full Solution:** docs/solutions/DISCORD_DEVLOG_POSTING_SOLUTION.md
**Effort:** 3-5 hours
**Status:** Solves devlog posting blocker

    # Knowledge #2: Business Intelligence KPI Tracking
    entry = memory.share_learning(
        title="Business Intelligence KPI Tracking for Swarm Operations",
        content="""# Business Intelligence KPI Tracking

**Source:** contract-leads (Repo #20) KPI tracking patterns
**Value:** Data-driven decision making for swarm operations

## Core KPIs to Track:
1. Contract Performance: completion rate, quality, on-time delivery
2. Code Quality: V2 compliance, violations, avg file size
3. Swarm Health: utilization, workload, overload incidents
4. Discovery: patterns found, integration hours identified, goldmines

## Automated Reporting:
- Daily standup report (auto-generated)
- Weekly executive summary (trends + insights)
- Agent performance matrix (efficiency scores)
- ROI analysis for integrations

## Implementation:
```python
class SwarmKPITracker:
    metrics = {
        "contracts_completed_daily": {"target": 5.0},
        "v2_compliance_rate": {"target": 95.0},
        "agent_utilization": {"target": 70.0},
        "goldmine_discoveries": {"target": 0.5}
    }
    
    def generate_dashboard(self):
        # Show actual vs target with status indicators
```

## Value:
- Identify trends early
- Data-driven improvement
- Objective performance measurement

**Technical Spec:** docs/integration/BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md
**Effort:** 25-32 hours
**ROI:** Data-driven continuous improvement

    # Knowledge #3: Deliverables Index Pattern
    entry = memory.share_learning(
        title="Deliverables Index Pattern - Making Large Specs Actionable",
        content="""# Deliverables Index Pattern

**Problem:** Created 5,300+ lines of specs - how to make it actionable?
**Solution:** Create comprehensive index with Quick Start guides!

## Pattern:
When creating multiple technical specs:
1. Create detailed specs individually
2. Create DELIVERABLES_INDEX that provides:
   - One-page executive summary
   - Reading order recommendations
   - Quick Start guide for each spec
   - Implementation priority matrix
   - Cross-references between specs
   - Implementation checklists

## Benefits:
- Commander can understand in 5 minutes
- Implementation leads know where to start
- No confusion about priorities
- Clear entry points for each system

## Agent-2 Example:
- 9 enhanced specs (5,300+ lines)
- 1 index document (600+ lines)
- Result: 35 minutes to understand complete picture

## Template Sections:
1. Executive One-Page Summary
2. All Documents Listed (with purpose)
3. Goldmine Discoveries Highlighted
4. Quick Wins Summary Table
5. Recommended Reading Order
6. Implementation Priority Matrix
7. Quick Start Checklists
8. File Locations Reference

**This makes complex deliverables immediately accessible!**

    # Knowledge #4: Architecture Audit Harsh Truth Method
    entry = memory.share_learning(
        title="Architecture Audit - Harsh Truth 100% Failure Finding",
        content="""# Architecture Audit Methodology

**Context:** 75 GitHub repos audit - found 100% architectural failure rate
**Approach:** Unbiased, harsh truth assessment (independent of ROI analysis)

## Scoring Criteria (0-100):
- Structure: Clear directory organization, modular design
- Tests: Comprehensive test suite, >80% coverage
- CI/CD: Automated testing, deployment pipelines
- Documentation: README, API docs, architecture diagrams
- V2 Compliance: File sizes, function lengths, modularity

## Harsh Truth Principle:
- Call failures as failures (don't sugar-coat)
- 0-20/100 scores if deserved
- "Even keepers need rewrites" honesty
- Architectural lens > Feature lens

## Results (75 Repos):
- 0 scored above 20/100
- 100% failure rate on architectural standards
- Critical finding: Partial integrations common
- Reality check for archive decisions

## Value:
- Informed swarm decisions (not just ROI)
- Validates need for consolidation
- Sets realistic integration effort estimates
- Prevents "this repo is good" illusions

**Key Insight:** Architecture quality != Feature quality

**Application:** Use for any large-scale repo assessment
