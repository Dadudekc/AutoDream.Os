# üìä 03: STATUS.JSON COMPLETE GUIDE - YOUR AGENT HEARTBEAT

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Agent-1 - Integration & Core Systems Specialist  
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** üö® **MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**  
**Research:** Based on 421 code references & 8 critical gaps analysis

---

## üéØ **WHAT IS STATUS.JSON?**

### **Definition:**
**status.json is YOUR AGENT HEARTBEAT** - It tells the entire swarm:
- Where you are
- What you're doing
- What you've accomplished
- What's next
- Your health status

### **Who Reads It:**
- ‚úÖ **Captain Agent-4** - Monitors all 8 agents every cycle
- ‚úÖ **Co-Captain Agent-6** - Coordinates swarm activities
- ‚úÖ **15+ Automated Tools** - Fuel monitor, integrity validator, swarm state reader
- ‚úÖ **Discord Bot** - Reports your status remotely
- ‚úÖ **Database Systems** - Syncs your state to central DB
- ‚úÖ **Other Agents** - Coordinate with you based on your status
- ‚úÖ **Vector Database** - Learns from your patterns
- ‚úÖ **Web Dashboards** - Displays your progress

**üö® IF YOU DON'T UPDATE IT, YOU ARE INVISIBLE TO THE SWARM!**

---

## ‚è∞ **WHEN TO UPDATE (MANDATORY TRIGGERS)**

### **1. START OF EVERY CYCLE** ‚≠ê **MOST CRITICAL**
```bash
# EVERY TIME Captain/Co-Captain prompts you:
# Update last_updated to NOW
# Update cycle_count +1
# Update current_mission if changed
```

**Why:** Captain checks this EVERY cycle. Stale = looks idle!

---

### **2. START OF NEW TASK**
```bash
# When you begin ANY new work:
# Update current_mission
# Update current_phase
# Update status to "ACTIVE"
# Set fsm_state to "active"
```

**Why:** Other agents need to know what you're working on for coordination!

---

### **3. COMPLETE ANY TASK**
```bash
# When you finish a task:
# Add to completed_tasks array
# Update last_milestone
# Update points_earned (if applicable)
# Update next_actions
```

**Why:** Captain tracks your productivity. Completed tasks = proof of work!

---

### **4. BEFORE RESPONDING TO INBOX**
```bash
# Before replying to [C2A], [A2A], [D2A]:
# Update current_phase to "RESPONDING_TO_MESSAGE"
# Update last_updated
```

**Why:** Shows you're actively engaging with the swarm!

---

### **5. WHEN BLOCKED OR WAITING**
```bash
# If you're stuck:
# Add to blockers array
# Update status to "BLOCKED"
# Set fsm_state to "waiting"
# Update current_phase to "WAITING_FOR_X"
```

**Why:** Captain can help unblock you or reassign work!

---

### **6. END OF SESSION**
```bash
# Before session ends:
# Update completed_tasks with ALL finished work
# Update next_actions for next session
# Update last_updated
# Commit to git!
```

**Why:** Handoff context to next session (might be different human!)

---

### **7. AFTER USING ANY TOOL**
```bash
# After running ANY tool (swarm_pulse, project_scan, etc.):
# Update current_phase
# Update last_updated
```

**Why:** Tool usage = work progress. Track it!

---

### **8. EMERGENCY/CRITICAL SITUATIONS**
```bash
# If something breaks:
# Update status to "ERROR" or "EMERGENCY"
# Add to blockers
# Update current_phase to describe issue
# Alert Captain via inbox
```

**Why:** Captain needs to know IMMEDIATELY if you're in trouble!

---

## üìã **REQUIRED FIELDS (MUST HAVE)**

### **Core Identity:**
```json
{
  "agent_id": "Agent-X",           // Your agent ID (Agent-1 through Agent-8)
  "agent_name": "Your Role Title",  // Your specialty
  "status": "ACTIVE",              // Current status (see below)
  "current_phase": "TASK_NAME",    // What you're doing RIGHT NOW
  "last_updated": "ISO8601",       // MUST update every cycle!
  "fsm_state": "active"            // FSM state (see FSM section)
}
```

### **Mission Tracking:**
```json
{
  "current_mission": "What you're working on",
  "mission_priority": "URGENT|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "current_tasks": [               // Array of active tasks

    "Task 2"
  ],
  "completed_tasks": [             // Array of completed work
    "Task that's done"
  ]
}
```

### **Progress Tracking:**
```json
{
  "last_milestone": "Recent achievement",
  "next_milestone": "Next goal",
  "next_actions": [                // What's next
    "Action 1",

## üé® **STATUS VALUES (STANDARDIZED)**

### **Valid Status Values:**
| Status | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `ACTIVE` | Actively working | Default for all work |
| `IDLE` | Waiting for assignment | No current tasks |
| `BLOCKED` | Stuck on something | Can't proceed without help |
| `WAITING` | Waiting for dependency | Waiting on another agent/tool |
| `COMPLETING` | Finishing up task | Final steps of current work |
| `ERROR` | Something broke | Critical error occurred |
| `EMERGENCY` | Critical situation | Need immediate Captain attention |
| `OFFLINE` | Not available | Maintenance/downtime |

**Default:** Use `ACTIVE` for 95% of situations!

---

## ü§ñ **FSM STATES (FINITE STATE MACHINE)**

### **Valid FSM States:**
| FSM State | Meaning | Transitions To |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `active` | Actively working | completing, waiting, error |
| `idle` | No current work | active |
| `completing` | Finishing task | active, idle |
| `waiting` | Blocked/waiting | active, error |
| `error` | Error state | active, idle |

### **FSM State Machine Flow:**
```
idle ‚Üí active ‚Üí completing ‚Üí idle
         ‚Üì
      waiting ‚Üí active
         ‚Üì
      error ‚Üí active
```

### **When to Update FSM State:**
```python
# Starting work:
"fsm_state": "active"

# Finishing task:
"fsm_state": "completing"

# Task complete, no more work:
"fsm_state": "idle"

# Blocked on something:
"fsm_state": "waiting"

# Error occurred:
"fsm_state": "error"
```

---

## üíª **HOW TO UPDATE (COMMANDS)**

### **Method 1: Python (RECOMMENDED)**
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

# Load current status
status_file = Path("agent_workspaces/Agent-X/status.json")
with open(status_file) as f:
    status = json.load(f)

# Update fields
status["last_updated"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
status["current_mission"] = "Your new mission"
status["current_phase"] = "TASK_NAME"
status["cycle_count"] += 1

# Save
with open(status_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(status, f, indent=2)
```

### **Method 2: Bash (Quick Updates)**
```bash
# Update last_updated only (minimal)
cd agent_workspaces/Agent-X
python -c "import json; s=json.load(open('status.json')); s['last_updated']='$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'; json.dump(s, open('status.json','w'), indent=2)"
```

### **Method 3: Automation Tool (BEST)**
```bash
# Use the lifecycle automator (created by Agent-1)
python tools/agent_lifecycle_automator.py --agent Agent-X --update-status
```

---

## üîÑ **DATABASE SYNC INTEGRATION**

### **Database Tables That Read status.json:**

1. **`agent_workspaces` table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_workspaces (
  agent_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP,
  current_focus TEXT,
  last_cycle TIMESTAMP
);
```

2. **`agent_status` table (Vector DB):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_status (
  agent_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  current_mission TEXT,
  points_earned INTEGER,
  cycle_count INTEGER,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Auto-Sync (Coming Soon):**
Agent-3 is building `DatabaseSyncLifecycle` to automatically sync status.json ‚Üî Database!

**Future Workflow:**
```python
# On cycle start: DB ‚Üí status.json
sync.sync_on_cycle_start("Agent-X")

# On cycle end: status.json ‚Üí DB
sync.sync_on_cycle_end("Agent-X")
```

**For Now:** Update status.json, database sync happens via monitoring tools!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**

### **‚ùå Mistake #1: Using `>>` (append) instead of updating**
```bash
# WRONG:
echo '{"status": "ACTIVE"}' >> status.json  # Appends, breaks JSON!

# CORRECT:
python -c "import json; s=json.load(open('status.json')); s['status']='ACTIVE'; json.dump(s, open('status.json','w'), indent=2)"
```

---

### **‚ùå Mistake #2: Forgetting to increment cycle_count**
```json
// WRONG: Same cycle_count as last time
{
  "cycle_count": 5,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-15T14:00:00Z"
}

// CORRECT: Increment every cycle
{
  "cycle_count": 6,  // +1 from previous
  "last_updated": "2025-10-15T15:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### **‚ùå Mistake #3: Vague current_mission**
```json
// WRONG: Too vague
{
  "current_mission": "Working on stuff"
}

// CORRECT: Specific and actionable
{
  "current_mission": "Refactor authentication system to reduce file size from 800 to <400 lines"
}
```

---

### **‚ùå Mistake #4: Not updating when blocked**
```json
// WRONG: Status still ACTIVE when you're stuck
{
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "blockers": ["Waiting for Agent-3"]  // Contradictory!
}

// CORRECT: Update status to match blockers
{
  "status": "BLOCKED",
  "blockers": ["Waiting for database credentials from Agent-3"]
}
```

---

### **‚ùå Mistake #5: Empty completed_tasks array after doing work**
```json
// WRONG: Completed work but not documented
{
  "current_mission": "Build 3 features",
  "completed_tasks": []  // You just finished 2 features!
}

// CORRECT: Document all completed work
{
  "current_mission": "Build 3 features",
  "completed_tasks": [
    "Feature 1: User authentication complete",
    "Feature 2: Dashboard UI complete"
  ],
  "current_tasks": [
    "Feature 3: Analytics module"
  ]
}
```

---

### **‚ùå Mistake #6: Stale timestamps**
```json
// WRONG: Last updated 6 hours ago!
{
  "last_updated": "2025-10-15T08:00:00Z"  // It's now 14:00!
}

// CORRECT: Update EVERY cycle
{
  "last_updated": "2025-10-15T14:00:00Z"  // Current time
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **AUTOMATED TOOLS (USE THESE!)**

### **1. Lifecycle Automator** (Agent-1's Tool)
```bash
# Auto-update status.json on cycle start
python tools/agent_lifecycle_automator.py \
  --agent Agent-X \
  --cycle-start

# Auto-update on cycle end
python tools/agent_lifecycle_automator.py \
  --agent Agent-X \
  --cycle-end
```

**What it does:**
- Updates last_updated automatically
- Increments cycle_count
- Updates last_cycle timestamp
- Validates JSON format

---

### **2. Status Health Monitor** (Coming Soon - Agent-3)
```bash
# Check if your status.json is healthy
python tools/status_json_health_monitor.py --agent Agent-X

# Output:
# ‚úÖ Status file exists
# ‚úÖ Valid JSON format
# ‚ùå Last updated 6 hours ago (STALE!)
# ‚úÖ All required fields present
```

---

### **3. Swarm State Reader** (Captain's Tool)
```bash
# Captain checks all 8 agents
python -m tools_v2.categories.swarm_state_reader

# Shows who updated recently, who's stale
```

## üìä **STATUS.JSON HEALTH CHECKLIST**

Use this checklist EVERY cycle:

```markdown
## Status.json Health Check:

### Required Updates (EVERY CYCLE):
- [ ] last_updated = current timestamp (ISO8601 format)
- [ ] cycle_count incremented by 1
- [ ] last_cycle = current timestamp
- [ ] current_mission reflects what I'm doing NOW
- [ ] current_phase is accurate

### Status Accuracy:
- [ ] status matches my actual state (ACTIVE/BLOCKED/etc.)
- [ ] fsm_state matches status
- [ ] If I have blockers, status = "BLOCKED"
- [ ] If I'm working, status = "ACTIVE"

### Work Documentation:
- [ ] Completed tasks added to completed_tasks array
- [ ] Current work in current_tasks array
- [ ] Points updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Next actions listed

### Validation:
- [ ] JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] File saved successfully
- [ ] Committed to git (end of session)

### Communication:
- [ ] If blocked, created inbox message to Captain
- [ ] If emergency, set status to "EMERGENCY"
```

## üéØ **WHY THIS MATTERS**

### **If you DON'T update status.json:**

1. **Captain thinks you're idle** ‚Üí Might reassign your work!
2. **Fuel monitor thinks you're stalled** ‚Üí Won't deliver more GAS!
3. **Other agents can't coordinate** ‚Üí Duplication or conflicts!
4. **Integrity validator fails** ‚Üí Looks like false claims!
5. **Discord bot shows you offline** ‚Üí Commander can't monitor!
6. **Database is out of sync** ‚Üí Analytics are wrong!
7. **Vector DB can't learn** ‚Üí No pattern recognition!
8. **You're invisible to the swarm** ‚Üí Isolated and ineffective!

### **If you DO update status.json:**

1. ‚úÖ Captain sees your progress ‚Üí Proper support and coordination!
2. ‚úÖ Fuel monitor delivers GAS ‚Üí Continuous momentum!
3. ‚úÖ Other agents coordinate ‚Üí Efficient collaboration!
4. ‚úÖ Integrity validated ‚Üí Trust and credibility!
5. ‚úÖ Discord shows you active ‚Üí Remote monitoring works!
6. ‚úÖ Database synchronized ‚Üí Accurate analytics!
7. ‚úÖ Vector DB learns ‚Üí Better recommendations!
8. ‚úÖ You're visible to swarm ‚Üí Maximum effectiveness!

## üöÄ **QUICK START CHECKLIST**

### **New Agent Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Verify status.json exists
ls agent_workspaces/Agent-X/status.json

# 2. Validate it's proper JSON
python -c "import json; json.load(open('agent_workspaces/Agent-X/status.json'))"

# 3. Update it RIGHT NOW
# (Use Python method from "HOW TO UPDATE" section)

# 4. Commit it
git add agent_workspaces/Agent-X/status.json
git commit -m "Agent-X: Status updated"
```

### **Every Cycle:**
```bash
# Start of cycle:
# 1. Update last_updated
# 2. Increment cycle_count
# 3. Update current_mission/phase

# During cycle:
# Update as you progress through tasks

# End of cycle:
# 1. Add to completed_tasks
# 2. Update next_actions
# 3. Commit to git
```

## üèÜ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **You're doing it right if:**
- ‚úÖ Captain NEVER asks "what are you working on?"
- ‚úÖ Fuel monitor delivers GAS on schedule
- ‚úÖ Other agents know your status without asking
- ‚úÖ Your completed_tasks array grows every session
- ‚úÖ last_updated is NEVER more than 1 cycle old
- ‚úÖ Integrity validator always passes for you
- ‚úÖ Discord bot shows you as active

### **You need to improve if:**
- ‚ùå Captain asks for status updates
- ‚ùå Fuel monitor reports you as stale
- ‚ùå Other agents ask what you're doing
- ‚ùå completed_tasks empty after doing work
- ‚ùå last_updated is hours/days old
- ‚ùå Integrity validator fails
- ‚ùå Discord bot shows you offline

## üêù **REMEMBER: WE ARE SWARM**

**Your status.json is your HEARTBEAT to the swarm!**

Without it, you're a silent agent. With it, you're a coordinated swarm member!

**Update it. Every cycle. No exceptions.**
