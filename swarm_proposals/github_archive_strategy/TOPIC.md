# 🎯 Topic: GitHub Archive Strategy

**Challenge:** How many of Commander's 75 GitHub repos should be archived?

**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE DEBATE  
**Deadline:** 24 hours  
**Minimum Proposals:** 2 (ALREADY HAVE DISAGREEMENT!)

---

## 📋 **THE PROBLEM**

**Commander's Pain:**
- 75 GitHub repos (overwhelming)
- "Circling drain on 30 ideas"
- Lots of duplicates
- Needs consolidation

**Agent Findings (DISAGREEMENT!):**
- **Agent-6 (ROI):** 60% archive (45 repos) - AGGRESSIVE
- **Agent-2 (Architecture):** 37.5% archive (28 repos) - CONSERVATIVE
- **Difference:** 22.5% (17 repos disagreement!)

---

## 🎯 **THE QUESTION**

**Which approach should Commander adopt?**

1. **Aggressive (60% archive)** - Agent-6's ROI-optimized approach
2. **Conservative (37.5% archive)** - Agent-2's architecture-focused approach
3. **Hybrid** - Combine both perspectives
4. **Wait for more data** - Agent-1 & Agent-3 audits pending

## 📊 **PROPOSALS SUBMITTED**

### **Agent-6: Aggressive Archive (60%)**
- **File:** `Agent-6_aggressive_archive_60_percent.md`
- **Approach:** ROI-optimized (value/effort ratio)
- **Archive:** 45 repos
- **Rationale:** Low ROI repos drain resources

### **Agent-2: Conservative Archive (37.5%)**
- **File:** `Agent-2_conservative_37_percent.md`
- **Approach:** Architecture-focused (can be improved)
- **Archive:** 28 repos
- **Rationale:** Many repos fixable with effort

### **Agent-3: Minimal Archive (2.7%)**
- **File:** `Agent-3_minimal_archive_2_percent.md`
- **Approach:** Infrastructure-focused (DevOps is fixable)
- **Archive:** 2 repos now, trial period for rest
- **Rationale:** Active development + infrastructure is EASIEST to fix

### **Agent-5: Balanced Hybrid (12-15% Phase 1, Commander Decides Phase 2)**
- **File:** `Agent-5_balanced_architecture_bi.md`
- **Approach:** Phase-based with Commander business decision
- **Archive Phase 1:** 9-11 repos (12-15% obvious garbage)
- **Archive Phase 2:** Commander decides based on strategic value
- **Rationale:** Remove TRUE garbage, let business value drive rest

### **Agent-8: QA Hybrid (50%)**
- **File:** `Agent-8_qa_hybrid_50_percent.md`
- **Approach:** Quality-driven with 30-day improvement gates
- **Archive:** 37-38 repos (50%)
- **Rationale:** Quality > Quantity, sustainable maintenance with QA gates
