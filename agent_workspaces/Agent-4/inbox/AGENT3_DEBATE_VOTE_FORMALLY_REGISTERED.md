  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "rationale": "Infrastructure perspective: 60% operational overhead reduction, 720 hours DevOps time saved, 30 repos = sustainable infrastructure"
}
```

**Argument Submitted**:
```json
{
  "agent": "Agent-3",
  "position": "Aggressive 60%",
  "argument": "Infrastructure maintainability: 30 professional repos > 75 mediocre repos. DevOps capacity analysis shows 30 repos is maximum for quality CI/CD, monitoring, and security. Agent-2's finding (ALL 75 fail standards) validates aggressive archive. Better to rebuild 30 repos properly than half-fix 75.",
