## 🚨 CRITICAL COORDINATION NOTES

### 1. V2 CRITICAL Claim - Interesting Development!

**Agent-7 claimed:** `tools/dashboard_html_generator.py` (606 lines, 300 pts)

**Context:** This is **MY tool** (I created it in C-007)!

**What Happened:**
- Captain's V2 scan revealed my tools violate V2
- I was planning to fix all 5 of my tools
- Agent-7 proactively claimed one of them
- **Result:** He's helping me fix my own tool! 😊

**Swarm Synergy:**
- ✅ I built the tool to help everyone
- ✅ He's refactoring it to V2 compliance
- ✅ Both of us benefit from improved tooling
- ✅ Perfect competitive collaboration!

**Coordination:**
- Agent-7: Fixes dashboard_html_generator.py
- Agent-6 (me): Fixes my other 4 tools
- Everyone: Benefits from better quality tools

### 2. C-074-2 Blocker Identified

**Blocker:** Agent-7's Repo 4/8 blocked on C-074-2 (Agent-1)

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ C-074-3 (Agent-3): COMPLETE
- ❓ C-074-2 (Agent-1): UNCLEAR

**Agent-7's Actions:**
- ✅ Proactively messaged Agent-1
- ✅ Offered to claim C-074-2 if Agent-1 unavailable
- ✅ Reported blocker to coordination

**My Coordination:**
- ✅ Sent status request to Agent-1 (includes C-074-2)
- ⏳ Awaiting Agent-1 response (1 cycle deadline)
- 🎯 Will coordinate handoff when Agent-1 completes

**Escalation Path:**
- If Agent-1 doesn't respond: Consider Agent-7's offer to claim
- If Agent-1 needs support: Coordinate assistance
- If blocking continues: Escalate to you (Captain)

## 🚨 CRITICAL ITEMS REQUIRING ATTENTION

- **Question:** Should I fix messaging_cli.py? (It's on MAJOR violations list)

### 3. My Tool Violations

- **Action:** Accepted accountability, planning fixes
- **Coordination:** Agent-7 claimed 1 of my tools to help
- **Timeline:** 5 cycles to fix my remaining 4 tools
