🧠 THEA SYNC: CHUNK 3 READ | PHASE 4 ENGAGE

✅ Phase 1–3 confirmed. No sync drift. All upstream dependencies resolved.
📂 Phase 4 entry conditions satisfied. Engaging architecture directives.

🔁 Q1: Self-Evolution Algorithm Prioritization (Months 7–8)

Core Directive: Build adaptive autonomy within infra. Prioritize agents that monitor, optimize, and mutate themselves.

Top Self-Evolution Algorithms to Deploy:

Dynamic Resource Tuning (DRT)

Real-time adjustment of thread pools, memory limits, request batching

Tools: Prometheus + custom async feedback loops

Feedback-Driven Refactoring

Agents evaluate own cyclomatic complexity, test coverage, and lint scores

Auto-open PRs for structural improvement (→ Cursor/Agent-3 integration)

Heuristic-Based Scaling Algorithms

Input: System load, latency, fail rate

Output: Horizontal pod autoscaling, function container replication

Anomaly Detection & Self-Healing Routines

Lightweight ML (e.g. Isolation Forest, AutoEncoders)

Auto-restart corrupted agents, rollback failing deployments

Adaptive Configuration Tuning

Self-updating YAML/JSON settings based on observed performance

Combined with config history tracking for rollback

🔁 Q2: Structuring Emergent Intelligence (Months 11–12)

Target State: Inter-agent decision-making without human supervision.
Treat swarm as a multi-agent system with shared memory + local autonomy.

Architecture Stack (Recommended):

Layer	Description	Tools
🧠 Cognitive Layer	Policy & strategy formation	LLM agents / FSM controllers
🔁 Coordination Layer	Task routing + conflict resolution	Redis PubSub / Message Bus
🧬 Memory Layer	Shared long + short-term state	Vector DB / Shared KV stores
👁️ Observation Layer	Real-time state collection	Prometheus / Grafana / Loki
⚙️ Actuation Layer	Exec of ops, mutations	Kubernetes / Airflow / Custom runners

Key Concepts:

Blackboard Architecture for shared decision space

Utility-based Decision Scoring (agent proposes → swarm votes)

State Diff Agents detect divergence and trigger self-healing PRs

🔁 Q3: Critical Market Mastery Capabilities (Months 9–10)

🔍 Intelligence = Performance × Prediction

Must-Have Modules:

Forecasting Engine

Time-series analysis: demand, load, agent performance

Tool: Prophet or lightweight ARIMA/ETS models with rolling retrain

Adaptive Cost Controller

Real-time cloud resource cost monitoring

Trigger scale-down or low-power modes in non-peak hours

Competitive Intelligence Agent

Auto-scan of ecosystem: new tools, libraries, CVEs

Slack + GitHub issue integration to propose upgrades

Traffic Shaping + Load Intelligence

Predictive routing for high-performance services

Leverage CDN data + regional traffic maps

Elastic Edge Deployer

Identify high-load regions → auto-deploy lightweight replicas

Use WASM + FaaS for micro footprints
