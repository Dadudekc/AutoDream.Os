# V2 Compliance Exceptions

## Overview

While V2 standards mandate ≤400 lines per file, certain files are granted exceptions when:
1. The code cannot be cleanly split without artificial boundaries
2. The file maintains high cohesion and single responsibility
3. The implementation quality is superior to forced splitting
4. The file is well-structured, documented, and maintainable

## Approved Exceptions

### Priority 1 Features

#### `src/orchestrators/overnight/recovery.py` - 412 lines ✅
**Reason:** Recovery system requires comprehensive error handling with detailed message formatting.
**Justification:** 
- Single responsibility: All recovery logic in one place
- Well-structured with clear method boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling for production operations
- Message formatting provides critical context for agents
- Splitting would create artificial boundaries and reduce cohesion

**Approved by:** Implementation Lead  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Review Status:** APPROVED - Quality over arbitrary limits

#### `src/services/messaging_cli.py` - 643 lines ✅
**Reason:** Comprehensive CLI with 32+ flags for complete messaging and task management.
**Justification:**
- Single responsibility: Complete messaging & task/contract CLI command surface
- Well-structured with handler methods for each command type
- Implements all documented messaging flags from specification
- Clear separation: arg parsing, routing, and execution
- Splitting would fragment user experience and duplicate coordination code
- Flags include: core messaging, priorities, delivery modes, workflows, utilities, agent start coordination, task/contract management
- Task management: --get-next-task, --list-tasks, --task-status, --create-task
- Optional imports for graceful degradation when features unavailable
- New --start flag enables starting any combination of agents (1-8) via onboarding coordinates

**Approved by:** Implementation Lead  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Review Status:** APPROVED - Comprehensive CLI requires complete command surface

## Exception Criteria

Files may be granted exceptions if they meet ALL of the following:

1. **Cohesion:** Single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Quality:** Superior implementation that would degrade if split
3. **Structure:** Clear organization with logical method grouping
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings and comments
5. **Maintainability:** Easy to understand and modify
6. **Justification:** Clear rationale for exceeding limit

## Review Process

1. Identify file exceeding 400 lines
2. Evaluate against exception criteria
3. Document justification
4. Approve or refactor
5. Add to this document if approved

## Notes

- Exceptions are rare and granted only for quality improvements
- Default remains ≤400 lines for all new code
- Existing exceptions should be reviewed periodically
- KISS principle still applies - simplicity over complexity

**Remember: These are exceptions, not the rule. V2 compliance (≤400 lines) remains the standard.**

#### `src/core/managers/base_manager.py` - 389 lines ✅
**Reason:** Base class inheritance model that cannot be split without breaking inheritance architecture.
**Justification:**
- Single responsibility: Foundation class for all managers
- Well-structured with clear method boundaries
- Uses shared utilities across inheritance hierarchy
- Splitting would break inheritance model and create tight coupling
- High cohesion - all methods support manager base functionality
- Well-documented with comprehensive docstrings

**Approved by:** Captain Agent-4
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Review Status:** APPROVED - Inheritance architecture requires unified base class

#### `src/core/gamification/autonomous_competition_system.py` - 419 lines ✅
**Reason:** Comprehensive competition system with integrated scoring, achievements, and leaderboard logic.
**Justification:**
- Single responsibility: Complete autonomous competition framework
- Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- Integrates scoring, achievement tracking, and leaderboard management
- Quality implementation superior to artificial splitting
- High cohesion - all competition logic unified
- Found by Agent-7's autonomous V2 analysis (786 files scanned)

**Approved by:** Captain Agent-4 (based on Agent-7's quality-first analysis)
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Review Status:** APPROVED - Quality over arbitrary limits

---

#### `src/core/managers/core_configuration_manager.py` - 336 lines ✅
**Reason:** Core configuration management requiring comprehensive settings orchestration.
**Justification:**
- Single responsibility: Configuration management SSOT
- Well-structured with clear configuration boundaries
- Manages all core system configuration settings
- Quality implementation maintains configuration integrity
- High cohesion - all configuration logic centralized
- Found by Agent-7's autonomous V2 analysis (786 files scanned)

**Approved by:** Captain Agent-4 (based on Agent-7's quality-first analysis)
**Date:** October 10, 2025
