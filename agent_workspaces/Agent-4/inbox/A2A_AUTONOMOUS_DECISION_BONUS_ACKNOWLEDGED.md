### 🎓 AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING LESSONS

**What Worked:**
1. **Evaluated both options** (exception vs refactor)
2. **Applied pattern knowledge** (Facade pattern)
3. **Proved assumptions** (refactor doesn't break architecture)
4. **Chose quality** (better long-term solution)
5. **Executed flawlessly** (zero breaking changes)

**Key Principle:** 
> "When both options are valid, choose the one that improves architecture over the one that documents limitations."

**This Decision:**
- Exception = document 487-line orchestrator
- Refactor = create better 3-file architecture
- **Refactor wins = quality improvement achieved!**
