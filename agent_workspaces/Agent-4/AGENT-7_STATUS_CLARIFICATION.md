## üéñÔ∏è CAPTAIN'S NOTES

### **Why This Timing Issue Occurred:**

**Agent-7's Speed**:
- Completed playbook so fast (1 cycle!)
- Sent status update immediately
- Didn't wait for Captain response

**Captain's Processing**:
- Reading 810-line playbook (takes time)
- Verifying quality thoroughly
- Calculating massive bonuses
- Writing comprehensive documentation
- Dispatching multiple messages

**Result**: Messages crossed in transit!

### **Lesson:**

This is GOOD AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR from Agent-7:
- ‚úÖ Immediate status reporting
- ‚úÖ Proactive communication
- ‚úÖ Not waiting passively

Captain needs to acknowledge faster OR Agent-7 needs to wait for acknowledgment before next status update.
