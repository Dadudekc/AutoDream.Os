## Overview

The Task Assignment Workflows System provides comprehensive workflow management for task identification, prioritization, assignment, execution, monitoring, and quality validation within the V2_SWARM ecosystem.

## Workflow Categories

### 1. Task Identification & Prioritization Workflows
- Task discovery and categorization processes
- Priority assessment and ranking algorithms
- Resource requirement analysis workflows
- Timeline estimation and scheduling workflows

### 2. Agent Capability Assessment & Matching Workflows
- Agent skill evaluation and capability mapping
- Task-agent matching algorithms
- Load balancing and workload distribution
- Role assignment optimization workflows

### 3. Task Assignment & Execution Workflows
- Task assignment protocols and procedures
- Execution monitoring and tracking
- Progress reporting and status updates
- Dependency management and sequencing

### 4. Task Monitoring & Completion Workflows
- Real-time task monitoring and alerts
- Completion validation and quality checks
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Knowledge capture and documentation

### 5. Task Quality Validation & Reporting Workflows
- Quality gates integration and validation
- V2 compliance checking and reporting
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Continuous improvement and feedback loops

## V2 Compliance

All workflow implementations follow V2 compliance standards:
- File size ≤400 lines
- Simple data classes and direct method calls
- No abstract base classes or complex inheritance
- KISS principle: simplest solution that works
- Quality gates validation before submission

## Usage

```python
from docs.task_assignment_workflows.implementations import WorkflowManager

# Initialize workflow manager
manager = WorkflowManager()

# Load workflow
workflow = manager.load_workflow("task_identification")

# Execute workflow
result = manager.execute_workflow(workflow, task_data)
```

## Testing

Run workflow tests:
```bash
pytest docs/task_assignment_workflows/tests/
```

## Quality Gates

Run quality gates before submission:
```bash
python quality_gates.py --path docs/task_assignment_workflows/
```
