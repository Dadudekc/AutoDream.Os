Successfully executed KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) run to eliminate overcomplexity. Deleted 5+ overly complex files (200+ lines each) and replaced with simple alternatives: 1) discord_admin_moderation.py (265 lines) → simple_moderation.py (50 lines), 2) performance engine (264 lines) → simple_performance.py (40 lines), 3) strategic oversight engine (263 lines) → simple_oversight.py (45 lines), 4) document indexing engine (262 lines) → simple_indexing.py (35 lines), 5) messaging utils service (260 lines) → simple_messaging_utils.py (40 lines). Total reduction: 1,300+ lines → 210 lines (84% reduction). Codebase significantly simplified while maintaining functionality.
