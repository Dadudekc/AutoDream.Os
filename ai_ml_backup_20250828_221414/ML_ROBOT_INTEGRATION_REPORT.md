## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE INTEGRATION APPROACH**

### **V2 Standards Compliance**
Following the **"USE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE FIRST"** principle:

- ✅ **Extended existing ML robot systems** rather than created new ones
- ✅ **Integrated with existing coordinate manager** via `CoordinateManager`
- ✅ **Leveraged existing messaging system** via `UnifiedPyAutoGUIMessaging`
- ✅ **Connected to existing agent coordinator** via `AgentCoordinatorOrchestrator`
- ✅ **Preserved existing ML robot functionality** while adding integration capabilities

### **Integration Architecture**
```
Existing ML Robot Systems:
├── ml_robot_config.py      (Configuration models)
├── ml_robot_creator.py     (Task creation)
├── ml_robot_processor.py   (Experiment execution)
└── ml_frameworks.py        (Framework management)

NEW Integration Layer:
└── ml_robot_bridge.py      (Integration bridge)

Existing Core Infrastructure:
├── coordinate_manager.py    (Agent coordinates)
├── unified_pyautogui_messaging.py (Communication)
└── agent_coordinator.py    (Agent management)
```
