## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### pytest.ini Enhancements
```ini
# PARALLEL TESTING OPTIMIZATION
-n auto                    # Auto-detect CPU cores
--dist=loadscope          # Load-balanced distribution
--max-worker-restart=3     # Worker restart management
--worker-restart-delay=1   # Restart delay configuration

# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
--cache-clear              # Fresh cache management
--reuse-db                 # Database connection reuse
--import-mode=importlib    # Faster test discovery
```

### Parallel Testing Configuration
```ini
[tool:pytest.ini_options.parallel]
max_workers = "auto"           # Optimal worker count
worker_timeout = 300           # 5 minute timeout
worker_restart_delay = 1       # 1 second restart delay
max_worker_restart = 3         # Maximum restart attempts
dist = "loadscope"            # Load-balanced distribution
load_scope_threshold = 3      # Minimum tests per worker
```

### Advanced Markers System
```ini
# PARALLEL TESTING MARKERS
parallel_safe: marks tests as safe for parallel execution
parallel_unsafe: marks tests that must run sequentially
worker_safe: marks tests that can run in worker processes
worker_unsafe: marks tests that must run in main process
```
