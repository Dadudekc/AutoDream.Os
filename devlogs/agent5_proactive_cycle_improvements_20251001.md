3. **Best Practices Review**: Researched optimization techniques
4. **Code Design**: Created implementation patterns
5. **Impact Assessment**: Prioritized improvements by ROI

---

## Key Findings

### Current State
- **Cycle Time**: 2-5 minutes (average: 3.5 minutes)

- **Metrics**: No cycle performance tracking

### Bottlenecks Identified

**Critical Issues** (5):
1. Sequential processing - missing parallelization opportunities
2. Redundant database queries - same data fetched multiple times
3. No predictive task assignment - reactive approach
4. Limited cross-agent learning - insights not shared
5. No performance metrics - can't measure improvements

**Medium Issues** (5):
6. Manual role switching overhead
7. Delayed error detection
8. Inbox processing bottleneck
9. Tool discovery lag
10. No cycle prediction

**Optimization Opportunities** (5):
11. Swarm Brain underutilized
12. Vector database potential
13. Captain coordination automation
14. Workflow caching
15. Agent specialization learning
