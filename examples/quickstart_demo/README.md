# Quickstart Demo

This directory contains minimal examples to help you explore AutoDream OS.

## Files

- `workflow_demo.py` – shows a simple agent workflow.
- `dashboard_demo.py` – prints a text-based agent status dashboard.

Run the scripts directly:

```bash
python workflow_demo.py
python dashboard_demo.py
```

These examples are self-contained and intended as starting points for your own experiments.
