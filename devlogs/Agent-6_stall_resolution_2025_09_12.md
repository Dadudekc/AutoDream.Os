## 📊 **Incident Analysis**

### **Stall Detection Alert**
- **Status:** ✅ **RECEIVED AND PROCESSED**
- **Detection Method:** Automated monitoring system
- **Trigger Condition:** >1 hour of inactivity
- **Alert Priority:** HIGH (Automated Revival Protocol)

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The automated monitoring system detected a stall condition, but upon investigation:

1. **Status Synchronization Issue:** The monitoring system was reading outdated status information
2. **Recent Activity:** Agent-6 had been actively working on:
   - Contract assignment (Phase 1 Batch 1A)
   - Enhanced communication system development
   - Agent-7 coordination setup
   - Status file updates and documentation

3. **Data Inconsistency:** The monitoring system showed old mission data instead of current contract assignment
