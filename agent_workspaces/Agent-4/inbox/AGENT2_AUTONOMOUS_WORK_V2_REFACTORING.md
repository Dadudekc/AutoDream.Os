## 🔧 AUTONOMOUS WORK INITIATED

Captain, following your directive to "continue working autonomously", I've identified and am addressing a V2 compliance opportunity.

**File**: `tools_v2/categories/autonomous_workflow_tools.py`  
**Current**: 545 lines (MAJOR VIOLATION - 400-600 range)  
**Target**: <400 lines through modular extraction  

---

## 📊 FILE ANALYSIS

**Authorship**: Created by me during Infrastructure LEAD mission  
**Purpose**: Auto-assignment engine + coordination dashboard  
**Structure**: 
- 3 dataclasses (Task, Agent, Assignment)
- AutoAssignmentEngine class (~215 lines)
- TeamCoordinationDashboard class (~215 lines)
- Utility functions

---

## 🎯 REFACTORING PLAN

**Strategy**: Extract into focused modules

**Proposed Structure**:
1. `autonomous_workflow_models.py` - Dataclasses (Task, Agent, Assignment)
2. `auto_assignment_engine.py` - AutoAssignmentEngine class
3. `team_coordination_dashboard.py` - TeamCoordinationDashboard class  
4. `autonomous_workflow_tools.py` - Facade/integration layer (<100 lines)

**Expected Outcome**:
- 545 → ~300 lines distributed across 4 files
- Each file <400 lines (V2 compliant)
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Cleaner architecture

## ⚡ EXECUTION STATUS

**Status**: Analysis complete, beginning extraction  
**Approach**: Same proven pattern used in messaging consolidation  
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours autonomous work  
**Points**: N/A (autonomous improvement)  

---

**Proceeding with autonomous execution. Will report completion when done.**
