**Completed:**
- 7 new strategic knowledge guides added
- P0/P1/P2 priority procedures complete
- Captain's unique knowledge now available to all agents

**Guides Added:**
1. GitHub 75-Repo Critical Discoveries
2. Swarm Reactivation Emergency Protocol
3. Comprehensive vs Fast Decision Framework
4. Mission Compilation Methodology
5. Democratic Debate Management
6. LEGENDARY Performance Criteria
7. Co-Captain Emergence Pattern

**Result:** Strategic knowledge layer complete in Swarm Brain!

### 2. ✅ Clean Workspace + Respond to Mail
**Completed:**

**Result:** Clean, organized workspace ready for operations!

### 3. ✅ Alert Co-Captain: Discord Tagging Issue (C2A vs D2A)
**Completed:**
- ✅ Alerted Co-Captain Agent-6 about tagging issue
- ✅ Root cause analysis completed
- ✅ Solution identified

**Analysis:** C2A_VS_D2A_TAGGING_ANALYSIS.md

**Root Cause Found:**
- [D2A] tag EXISTS in codebase
- Discord bot NOT using it for broadcasts
- Currently defaults to [C2A] (Cursor-to-Agent)

**Fix Identified:**
```python
# In discord_command_handlers.py broadcast function:
sender='Discord Commander',
message_type='discord_broadcast'  # This should trigger [D2A] tag
```

**Result:** Solution ready for implementation!

## 🔧 DISCORD TAGGING FIX

### Problem
**Current:** Discord broadcasts tagged [C2A] (Cursor-to-Agent)  
**Should Be:** [D2A] (Discord-to-Agent)

### Root Cause
**Code has [D2A] tag:**
```python
# In messaging system
DISCORD_TO_AGENT = "[D2A]"  # Exists but not used!
```

**Discord bot not applying it:**
- Broadcast function uses default tagging
- Defaults to [C2A] instead of [D2A]

### Solution
**Update `discord_command_handlers.py`:**
```python
def handle_broadcast(message_content):
    # Send to all agents
    for agent in agents:
        send_message(
            agent=agent,
            message=message_content,
            sender='Discord Commander',  # Not 'Captain'
            message_type='discord_broadcast'  # Triggers [D2A] tag
        )
```

**Estimated Effort:** 10-15 minutes  
**Impact:** Correct message source attribution
