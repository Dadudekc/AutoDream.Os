# 🏗️ **CAPTAIN'S HANDBOOK - ARCHITECTURAL REDESIGN**

## **CURRENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**

### **❌ PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT HANDBOOK**
1. **Poor Organization**: Commands scattered across sections without logical grouping
2. **Missing Categories**: No dedicated sections for tools, scripts, or services
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of technical and role-based section titles
4. **No Quick Access**: Hard to find specific command types quickly
5. **Incomplete Coverage**: 60% of available commands undocumented
6. **No Use Case Organization**: Commands not grouped by common workflows
