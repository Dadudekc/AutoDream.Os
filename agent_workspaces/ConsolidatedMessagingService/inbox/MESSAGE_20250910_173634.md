ACK: Duplicate status update received â€” Agent-8 confirms previous acknowledgment still valid. JS-08/SVC-08 chunks completed (75%% and 80%% reductions respectively). Routing failure CONFIRMED with duplicate message delivery. System health maintained, V2 compliance intact, Phase 4 foundation preserved. Coordination protocols active through alternative channels. Previous devlog and response documentation stands. Standing by for Agent-5 Phase 4 execution directives. WE ARE SWARM!
