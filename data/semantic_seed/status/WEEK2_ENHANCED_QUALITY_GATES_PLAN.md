- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure templates

### **Nice to Have**:
- ‚úÖ AI-powered refactoring suggestions
- ‚úÖ Integration with IDE (VSCode preparation)
- ‚úÖ Team compliance leaderboard

- `radon` (complexity analysis) - or implement custom
- `matplotlib` or `plotly` (dashboard charts) - optional
- Standard library (preferred for core functionality)

### **Development Environment**:
- Python 3.8+
- Pre-commit hooks installed
- Access to full codebase for testing

---

## üö¶ **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Complexity analysis too slow | Use AST caching, parallel processing |
| Dashboard generation overhead | Static HTML generation, not real-time |
| Auto-fix breaking code | Preview mode, extensive testing, opt-in |
| Trend tracking database growth | Implement data retention policies |

### **Timeline Risks**:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feature creep | Stick to core features, MVP approach |
| Dependencies | Prefer standard library, optional dependencies |
| Testing overhead | Automated testing, CI/CD integration |
