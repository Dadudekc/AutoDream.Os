✅ **No Duplicates**: Single ownership per cycle prevented duplicate work
✅ **Captain Checkpoints**: C-010 checkpoint review provided strategic oversight

### **System Components Validated**:
1. ✅ Sprint plans distributed successfully (all 8 agents)
2. ✅ Cycle timeline providing clear execution map
3. ✅ Anti-loop safeguards working (#DONE-Cxxx tags)
4. ✅ Handoff patterns executed correctly
5. ✅ Captain tracking system operational
6. ✅ Messaging system delivering to all coordinates
