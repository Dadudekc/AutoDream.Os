Test Thea Bidirectional Communication
====================================

Demonstrates the ability to:
1. Get a response from Thea
2. Send a follow-up message without stopping the cycle
3. Maintain continuous conversation flow

This proves real-time bidirectional communication is possible.

🌟 THEA'S STRATEGIC GUIDANCE - PHASE 2 PRIORITIES

🎯 TOP PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **WEB INTEGRATION SAFEGUARDS** - Agent-7's recommendations are excellent
   - Implement web monitoring protocols immediately
   - Set up integration testing frameworks
   - Establish user experience protection measures

2. **AGENT COORDINATION ENHANCEMENT**
   - Strengthen cross-agent communication protocols
   - Implement real-time status synchronization
   - Create automated coordination workflows

3. **SYSTEM STABILITY VALIDATION**
   - Complete Phase 1 verification for Agents 3 & 4
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring dashboards
   - Establish emergency rollback procedures

🐝 SWARM RECOMMENDATION: Continue Phase 2 with enhanced monitoring, but accelerate Agent 3/4 verification to ensure system stability.

What specific aspects would you like me to elaborate on?
