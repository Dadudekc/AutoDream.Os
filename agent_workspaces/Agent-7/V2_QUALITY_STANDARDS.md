- **CLI Interface Testing**: **100% coverage required** ✅
- **Test Execution**: **0 warnings or errors** ✅
- **Test Performance**: **<5 seconds per test average** ✅

### **5. 🖥️ CLI INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS**
- **Every module must have CLI interface for testing** ✅
- **Comprehensive argument parsing** ✅
- **Help documentation for all flags** ✅
- **Easy testing for agents** ✅
- **CLI must be the primary testing interface**

### **6. 🤖 AGENT USABILITY**
- **Agents must be able to easily test everything** ✅
- **Clear CLI interfaces** ✅
- **Comprehensive help systems** ✅
- **Simple testing commands** ✅
- **No complex setup required for testing**
