## 📊 **HOW TO MEASURE CAPTAIN SUCCESS**

Quantifiable metrics for evaluating Captain performance.

---

## 🎯 **PER-CYCLE METRICS**

### **Activation Success** (CRITICAL)

**Metric:** Agent activation rate

✅ **Target:** 100% (all 7 agents activated)  
⚠️ **Warning:** <100% (any agent missed)  
🚨 **Critical:** <85% (multiple agents idle)

**How to measure:**
```bash
# Check GAS status
python tools/captain_gas_check.py

# Count activated agents
grep "Message sent to Agent" logs/messaging.log | wc -l
```

**Success = All 7 agents receive activation messages**

---

### **Task Completion** (HIGH)

**Metric:** Captain's own task completion

✅ **Target:** 100% (task fully complete)  
⚠️ **Warning:** 50-99% (partial completion)  
🚨 **Critical:** <50% (minimal progress)

**How to measure:**
- Captain's own progress tracking
- Deliverables checklist completion
- Code committed and tested

**Success = Captain completes assigned task each cycle**

---

### **Documentation Quality** (HIGH)

**Metric:** Captain's log completeness

✅ **Target:** All sections updated  
⚠️ **Warning:** Some sections missing  
🚨 **Critical:** No log update

**Required sections:**

- [ ] Tasks assigned (all 7 agents)
- [ ] Messages sent
- [ ] Results achieved
- [ ] Lessons learned
- [ ] Next cycle planning

**Success = Captain's log fully updated every cycle**

---

### **Response Time** (MEDIUM)

**Metric:** Blocker resolution time

✅ **Target:** <1 hour  
⚠️ **Warning:** 1-4 hours  
🚨 **Critical:** >4 hours

**How to measure:**
- Time from blocker reported to resolved
- Track in Captain's log

**Success = Blockers resolved within 1 hour**

---

### **Agent Idle Time** (HIGH)

**Metric:** Unnecessary idle agent time

✅ **Target:** 0 agents idle unnecessarily  
⚠️ **Warning:** 1 agent idle >2 hours  
🚨 **Critical:** Multiple agents idle

**How to measure:**
```bash
python tools/captain_find_idle_agents.py
```

**Success = Zero agents idle without justified reason**

---

## 📈 **PER-SPRINT METRICS**

### **Sprint Goals Achievement**

**Metric:** Sprint objectives completed

✅ **Target:** 100% of sprint goals  
⚠️ **Warning:** 75-99%  
🚨 **Critical:** <75%

**How to measure:**

- Completed vs planned tasks
- Deliverables checklist

**Success = All sprint goals achieved**

---

### **V2 Compliance**

**Metric:** V2 compliance percentage

✅ **Target:** 100% (zero violations)  
⚠️ **Warning:** 95-99% (few violations)  
🚨 **Critical:** <95% (many violations)

**How to measure:**
```bash
python tools/run_project_scan.py --violations-only
# Count violations
```

**Success = 100% V2 compliance maintained**

---

### **Average ROI**

**Metric:** Return on investment per task

✅ **Target:** >15 average ROI  
⚠️ **Warning:** 10-15 ROI  
🚨 **Critical:** <10 ROI

**How to measure:**
```bash
python tools/captain_roi_quick_calc.py --sprint
```

**Success = Average ROI consistently >15**

---

### **Autonomy Advancement**

**Metric:** Autonomous systems progress

✅ **Target:** 3+ autonomy tasks per sprint  
⚠️ **Warning:** 1-2 autonomy tasks  
🚨 **Critical:** 0 autonomy tasks

**How to measure:**
- Count tasks tagged "Autonomy: 1/3" or higher
- Track in Captain's log

**Success = Continuous autonomy advancement**

---

### **Agent Satisfaction**

**Metric:** Agent feedback/performance

✅ **Target:** All agents performing well  
⚠️ **Warning:** Some agent concerns  
🚨 **Critical:** Agent complaints/friction

**How to measure:**
- Agent feedback in devlogs
- Completion rates
- Quality of deliverables
- Coordination smoothness

**Success = High agent satisfaction and performance**

---

### **Zero Critical Blockers**

**Metric:** Unresolved critical issues

✅ **Target:** 0 critical blockers  
⚠️ **Warning:** 1 critical blocker  
🚨 **Critical:** 2+ critical blockers

**How to measure:**
```bash
# Check for unresolved blockers
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-*/status.json | jq '.blockers'
```

**Success = No unresolved critical blockers**

---

## 🎯 **COMPOSITE SCORES**

### **Captain Effectiveness Score (CES)**

**Formula:**
```
CES = (Activation_Rate × 0.3) + 
      (Task_Completion × 0.2) +
      (Documentation_Quality × 0.15) +
      (Blocker_Response × 0.15) +
      (ROI_Achievement × 0.2)
```

**Ranges:**
- 90-100: Excellent (A)
- 80-89: Good (B)
- 70-79: Adequate (C)
- <70: Needs Improvement (D/F)

---

### **Swarm Health Index (SHI)**

**Formula:**
```
SHI = (Active_Agents / Total_Agents × 100) ×
      (1 - Idle_Time_Percentage) ×
      (Blocker_Resolution_Rate)
```

**Ranges:**
- 95-100: Excellent health
- 85-94: Good health
- 75-84: Fair health
- <75: Poor health

5. **Idle Time:** Did I keep agents productive?
6. **Quality:** Did we maintain V2 compliance?
7. **ROI:** Did we achieve target ROI?
8. **Autonomy:** Did we advance autonomous systems?
9. **Satisfaction:** Are agents performing well?
10. **Lessons:** What did I learn this week?

---

### **Monthly Goals:**

**Set 3 improvement goals each month:**
