## 🎯 **AUTONOMOUS LOOP FORMULA**

```
∀ agent ∈ Swarm:
  WHILE(opportunity_exists) {
    task = agent.identify_opportunity()
    agent.assign_self(task)
    v1 = agent.execute(task)
    metric1 = agent.measure(v1)
    
    WHILE(metric < acceptable_threshold) {
      v_next = agent.improve(v_current)
      metric_next = agent.measure(v_next)
      
      IF(metric_next > acceptable_threshold) {
        BREAK  // Production ready!
      }
      
      v_current = v_next
      metric_current = metric_next
    }
    
    agent.report_success()
    // Loop complete - ready for next opportunity!
  }
