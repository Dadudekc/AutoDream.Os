Continued autonomous work cycle by eliminating final small wrapper files and compatibility layers. Deleted 5+ additional small files that were importing from non-existent refactored files or had broken references: 1) benchmark_runner.py (12 lines), 2) agent_vector_integration.py (12 lines), 3) agent_enhancement_integrator.py (12 lines), 4) intelligent_context_optimization.py (11 lines), 5) vector_database_captain_cli.py (10 lines), 6) types.py (7 lines). Total cleanup: 64+ lines of dead code eliminated. Codebase further simplified by removing final broken import references and compatibility layers.
