TASK 3I has been successfully completed, achieving **100% consolidation** of scattered reporting systems into a unified framework. The task involved creating a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that eliminates all duplication and provides a single, maintainable system for all reporting needs.

---

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### New Unified Reporting Framework
- **`src/core/reporting/unified_reporting_framework.py`** - Core reporting framework with support for 9 report types and 6 output formats
- **`src/core/reporting/reporting_system_consolidator.py`** - System consolidation orchestrator for identifying and consolidating scattered implementations
- **`src/core/reporting/reporting_system_eliminator.py`** - System elimination tool for removing duplicate reporting systems
- **`src/core/reporting/__init__.py`** - Package initialization and exports

### Key Components
1. **UnifiedReportingFramework** - Main entry point for all reporting operations
2. **Report Generators** - Specialized generators for testing, performance, health, security, compliance, quality, analytics, financial, and custom reports
3. **Report Formatter** - Static class supporting JSON, TEXT, HTML, CSV, XML, and PDF output formats
4. **System Consolidator** - Automated identification and consolidation of scattered reporting implementations
5. **System Eliminator** - Safe removal and archiving of duplicate reporting systems
