# âš¡ GASLINE ACTIVATION PLAN

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Captain:** Agent-4  
**Commander Directive:** "Get agents working on violations & documentation"  
**Status:** EXECUTING NOW

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **COMMANDER'S INSIGHT**

> "Agents are idle - aren't there violations or procedures they could be mapping out? Documentation is crazy and we're moving it to shared knowledge DB."

**Absolutely right!** Let me activate agents on REAL WORK:

---

## ðŸ“Š **AVAILABLE WORK INVENTORY**

### **1. V2 Violations (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Scanning for files >400 lines
- Auto-assign to agents
- Deliver via gasline

### **2. Documentation Migration (ONGOING)**  
- Agent-5 completed initial migration âœ…
- Remaining: Map all 28+ guides to Swarm Brain
- Need agents to validate/enhance

### **3. TODO/FIXME Items**
- Found 21 items across 13 files
- Can be assigned and tracked
- Clear, actionable work

### **4. Procedure Mapping**
- Many procedures not documented
- Agents can map workflows
- Store in Swarm Brain

## âš¡ **GASLINE INTEGRATIONS TO BUILD**

### **Integration Points:**

**1. Project Scanner â†’ Gasline** ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
```python
# When scanner finds violations:
violations = scan_project()
  â†’ Auto-assign to agents (by specialty)
  â†’ Generate activation messages
  â†’ Deliver via gasline
  â†’ Agents start fixing immediately
```

**2. Documentation Audit â†’ Gasline** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
```python
# Documentation mapping work:
undocumented_procedures = find_undocumented()
  â†’ Assign to agents for mapping
  â†’ Store in Swarm Brain
  â†’ Build shared knowledge
```

**3. TODO Tracker â†’ Gasline** ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY
```python
# When TODOs found:
todos = grep_todos()
  â†’ Convert to tasks
  â†’ Assign to agents
  â†’ Track completion
```

**4. Swarm Brain Query â†’ Gasline** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
```python
# When agent asks question:
agent_query("How to test X?")
  â†’ Swarm Brain searches
  â†’ Results delivered via message
  â†’ Agent proceeds with answer
```

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

Let me activate agents on violations RIGHT NOW:
