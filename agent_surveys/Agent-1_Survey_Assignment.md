# üéØ AGENT-1 SURVEY ASSIGNMENT
## Services Integration Domain Survey

**Agent:** Agent-1 (Integration & Core Systems Specialist)
**Domain:** `src/services/` directory
**Deadline:** Discord Devlog Post by EOD Tomorrow
**Deliverable:** "Agent-1 Services Integration Survey Results"

---

## üìã YOUR MISSION

Conduct a comprehensive survey of the `src/services/` directory to map all integration patterns, service orchestration, and current consolidation status.

---

## üîç SURVEY REQUIREMENTS

### **1. Services Inventory**
**File:** `src/services/` directory
**Focus Areas:**
- All messaging and communication services
- Integration patterns and API endpoints
- Service orchestration and coordination
- External system integrations
- Data flow patterns and pipelines
- Current consolidation status in services
- Duplicate or redundant services identification

### **2. Detailed Analysis Required:**

#### **Service Categories Assessment:**
```python
# Analyze these service domains:
- src/services/messaging_*.py          # Messaging services
- src/services/contract_*.py           # Contract services
- src/services/coordination/           # Coordination services
- src/services/handlers/               # Command handlers
- src/services/models/                 # Service models
- src/services/*/                      # All service subdirectories
```

#### **Integration Pattern Analysis:**
- Service-to-service communication patterns
- API endpoint definitions and usage
- Data flow and pipeline architectures
- External system integration points
- Service discovery and registration patterns

#### **Consolidation Assessment:**
- Duplicate service identification
- Redundant functionality detection
- Service consolidation opportunities
- Import optimization potential
- Configuration consolidation status
