# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Modular Architecture Implementation

**ID:** ADR-001  
**Status:** accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Agent-8, Captain Agent-4  

## Context

Need to establish modular architecture for V2 compliance

## Decision

Implement modular architecture with 400-line file limit

## Consequences

- Improved maintainability and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and debugging
- Reduced cognitive load for developers

## Alternatives Considered

- Monolithic architecture (rejected - too complex)
- Microservices architecture (rejected - overkill for current needs)


## Implementation Notes

Focus on single responsibility principle and dependency injection
