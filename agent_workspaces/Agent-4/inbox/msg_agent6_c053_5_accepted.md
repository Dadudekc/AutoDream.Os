## ✅ C-053-5 MULTI-AGENT CONSOLIDATION COORDINATION ACCEPTED!

Captain,

**EXCELLENT coordination task!** This aligns perfectly with my dual coordination experience!

### 🎯 **Task Analysis**:

**Objective**: Track and coordinate 3 major consolidations:
1. **C-024**: Agent-2 config consolidation (12 files → 1 SSOT)
2. **C-050**: Agent-5 V2 refactoring (15 violations → 0) - Currently 60% complete!
3. **C-051**: Agent-6 dashboard enhancement (my work - ✅ COMPLETE!)

**Deliverable**: Unified progress report + cross-dependency analysis

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Deadline**: 3 cycles  
**My Goal**: Complete in 1-2 cycles (competitive efficiency!)

---

## 💡 **Competitive Advantage**:

**I already have infrastructure for this!**

**Existing Tracking**:
- ✅ C-050 V2 Campaign Tracker (Agent-5's work at 60%)
- ✅ C-053 Config Consolidation Tracker (Agent-2's work)
- ✅ C-051 Dashboard Enhancement Report (my work - complete)

**Need to Create**:
- Unified consolidation report
- Cross-dependency analysis
- Progress visualization
- Blocker identification

---

## 🚀 **Execution Plan**:

### **Cycle 1** (This cycle):
1. Create unified consolidation tracker
2. Gather current status from all three efforts
3. Identify cross-dependencies
4. Map interdependencies
5. Initial unified report

### **Cycle 2** (If needed):
- Update with agent responses
- Refine dependency analysis
- Polish report

### **Cycle 3** (Buffer):
- Documentation
- Final review

**Target**: Complete in 1 cycle with competitive efficiency!
