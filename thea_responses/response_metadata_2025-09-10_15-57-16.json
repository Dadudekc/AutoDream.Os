Agent Cellphone V2 Repository is in a stabilized mid-evolution state\u2014swarm coordination is functioning, file attachments are live, and orchestration is distributed across 13 files. System cohesion is emerging, but architecture is still partially fragmented.\n\nQuick status pulse across your options:\n\n\u2705 Option 1: Further Consolidation of Core Modules\n\nStatus: Mid-phase. Messaging, debate, and coordination scattered across overlapping modules.\n\nValue: Increases maintainability. Reduces redundancy. Critical before production or feature scale-up.\n\nRisk: Low. Mostly cleanup and optimization cycles.\n\nRecommendation: \u2705 Greenlight for immediate action.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Option 2: Enhanced Swarm Intelligence Features\n\nStatus: Baseline swarm logic functional, but decision fusion and emergent behavior likely shallow.\n\nValue: High payoff if consolidated logic already in place.\n\nRisk: High complexity. Could introduce architectural drift if done before consolidation.\n\nRecommendation: \u26a0\ufe0f Defer until core consolidation completes.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Option 3: Production Deployment Preparation\n\nStatus: Premature. Deployment before modular refactor = lock-in of messy internals.\n\nValue: Delivers final output\u2014but on unstable foundations.\n\nRisk:",
