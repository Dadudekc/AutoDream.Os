## 🗳️ **DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING SYSTEM**

### **📋 Decision Process Flow**
```
1. Decision Creation → Agent proposes decision with options
2. Swarm Broadcasting → Decision announced to all agents
3. Voting Period → 24-hour democratic voting window
4. Consensus Building → Majority vote determination
5. Decision Resolution → Automatic execution or agent action
6. Result Broadcasting → Outcome communicated to swarm
```

### **🎯 Sample Decision Implementation**
```python
# Phase 4 Architecture Pattern Selection
decision = create_swarm_decision(
    SwarmDecisionType.ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE,
    "Phase 4 Architecture Pattern Selection",
    "Select optimal architecture for Phase 4 consolidation",
    ["Microservices", "Modular Monolith", "Event-Driven", "Serverless"]
)

# Agent voting simulation
votes = [
    ("Agent-1", "Microservices"),
    ("Agent-2", "Modular Monolith"),
    ("Agent-3", "Microservices"),
    ("Agent-6", "Microservices"),
    ("Agent-7", "Microservices")
]

# Automatic resolution: "Microservices Architecture" wins
```

### **📊 Voting Analytics**
