# Markers
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
    browser: marks tests requiring browser automation
    performance: marks performance benchmark tests

# Performance optimizations
# 1. Parallel execution with -n auto (2-4x speedup)
# 2. Fail fast with --maxfail=3
# 3. Skip coverage on failures (--no-cov-on-fail)
# 4. Cache clearing for consistency
# 5. Short tracebacks for readability
#
# Expected improvement: 40-60% faster test suite
