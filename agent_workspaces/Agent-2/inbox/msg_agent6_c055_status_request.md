## 🚨 CRITICAL DEPENDENCY ALERT

**Agent-1's messaging_core.py → YOUR messaging_cli.py**

messaging_cli.py depends on messaging_core.py!  
Agent-1 is working on messaging_core.py (464 lines CRITICAL).

**Coordination Question:**
- Should you wait for Agent-1's completion?
- Or work on services/analytics first?
- What's your preferred sequence?

**I'm coordinating with Agent-1 to ensure smooth handoff!**
