# üéØ SSOT Agent Responsibilities Matrix - PHASE 2 STRUCTURE
**Role-Specific Duties for V2 Compliance Tracking**

## üìã **Overview**

This matrix defines specific Single Source of Truth (SSOT) responsibilities for each agent role in the **CURRENT PHASE 2** system. Each agent has unique duties that contribute to maintaining data consistency and compliance tracking effectiveness.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: These are the CURRENT Phase 2 roles, NOT the old V1 roles. All agents must understand their actual current assignments.

**Purpose**: Clear role definition and accountability for Phase 2  
**Scope**: All V2 agents and SSOT operations in Phase 2  
**Update Frequency**: As Phase 2 roles evolve or new responsibilities emerge

## üö® **Phase 2 Role Verification**

### **Before Starting Work**:
1. **Verify Current Role**: Check this document for your actual Phase 2 role
2. **Check Active Tasks**: Review your current contract assignments
3. **Understand SSOT Responsibilities**: Know your specific SSOT duties
4. **Report Role Confusion**: If you think you have the wrong role, ask immediately

### **Common Role Confusions to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå **Agent-3**: NOT multimedia/content - you are integration/testing
- ‚ùå **Agent-4**: NOT security/infrastructure - you are coordination/planning
- ‚ùå **Agent-1**: NOT foundation/testing - you are integration/core systems
- ‚ùå **Agent-2**: NOT AI/ML - you are manager specialization

## Phase 2 SSOT Success Metrics
- **Contract Completion**: 100% of assigned tasks completed with SSOT compliance
- **Architecture Compliance**: All work follows V2 standards and SSOT principles
- **Devlog Creation**: Every task documented in `logs/` directory
- **Continuous Workflow**: No idle time, always have active contracts
- **System Unification**: All workflow systems consolidated with SSOT consistency

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: If you're reading this and think you have the wrong role, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask for clarification. Working on the wrong tasks wastes time and delays Phase 2 completion.
