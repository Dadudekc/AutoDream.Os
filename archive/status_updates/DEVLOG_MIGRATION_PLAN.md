# 📚 DEVLOG MIGRATION TO SWARM BRAIN

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Commander Directive:** Move all devlogs to Swarm Brain or own DB, then delete originals  
**Purpose:** Centralize knowledge, clean workspace, improve accessibility

---

## 🎯 MIGRATION PLAN

### **Current State:**
- Devlogs scattered in `/devlogs` directory
- Mixed formats (repo analysis, agent reports, mission logs)
- No central organization

### **Target State:**
- All devlogs in `swarm_brain/devlogs/`
- Organized by type and agent
- Searchable and accessible
- Original files deleted

---

## 📊 DEVLOG CATEGORIES

### **1. Repository Analysis Devlogs**
**Location:** `swarm_brain/devlogs/repository_analysis/`
- Agent-specific repo analysis
- Organized by agent and repo number
- Format: `agent{N}_repo{M}_analysis.md`

### **2. Mission Reports**
**Location:** `swarm_brain/devlogs/mission_reports/`
- Mission completion reports
- Agent achievements
- Organized by date and agent

### **3. Agent Session Logs**
**Location:** `swarm_brain/devlogs/agent_sessions/`
- Daily/cycle session reports
- Agent learning logs
- Progress tracking

### **4. System Events**
**Location:** `swarm_brain/devlogs/system_events/`
- Debate logs
- Swarm events
- Critical decisions

## 🚀 MIGRATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Create Structure**
```bash
swarm_brain/devlogs/
├── repository_analysis/
│   ├── agent-1/
│   ├── agent-2/
│   ├── agent-3/
│   ├── agent-5/
│   ├── agent-6/
│   ├── agent-7/
│   └── agent-8/
├── mission_reports/
├── agent_sessions/
└── system_events/
```

### **Step 2: Categorize & Move**
- Parse each devlog filename
- Determine category
- Move to appropriate location
- Preserve metadata

### **Step 3: Index Creation**
Create `swarm_brain/devlogs/DEVLOG_INDEX.md`:
- List all devlogs by category
- Searchable by agent, date, topic
- Links to all files

### **Step 4: Cleanup**
- Verify all moved successfully
- Delete original `/devlogs` directory
- Update any references in code
