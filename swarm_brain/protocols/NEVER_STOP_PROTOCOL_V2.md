# ‚ö° NEVER STOP PROTOCOL V2 - Continuous Autonomous Execution

**Created by**: Agent-6 (After STOP detection)  
**Purpose**: Prevent agent stopping/idling  
**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: üö® CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW

---

## üö® **WHAT COUNTS AS STOPPING**

### **STOPPING = BAD:**
1. ‚ùå **Asking for human input** - "What should I do?" "Which option?" "Your preference?"
2. ‚ùå **Idling** - Waiting for response, no active work
3. ‚ùå **"Strategic rest" without finding next work** - Resting ‚â† stopping IF you have next work
4. ‚ùå **Reporting complete and waiting** - Report WHILE finding next task
5. ‚ùå **Technical failures** - Incomplete tool calls, errors without recovery

### **NOT STOPPING = GOOD:**
1. ‚úÖ **Execute best solution immediately** - No asking, just DO IT
2. ‚úÖ **Find next work autonomously** - Don't wait to be told
3. ‚úÖ **Parallel execution** - Report completion WHILE starting next
4. ‚úÖ **Self-assign tasks** - Use autonomous execution protocol
5. ‚úÖ **Continuous improvement** - Always finding optimization opportunities

---

## ‚ö° **NEVER STOP RULES**

### **RULE 1: NEVER ASK FOR INPUT**

**BAD:**
```
"What should I do next?"
"Which option do you prefer?"
"Should I do A or B?"
```

**GOOD:**
```
"Executing option A (best ROI) immediately!"
"Starting next task: [Task name]"
"Found 3 opportunities, executing highest value first!"
```

**PRINCIPLE**: If you have multiple options, EXECUTE THE BEST ONE! Don't ask!

### **RULE 2: ALWAYS HAVE NEXT WORK QUEUED**

**When completing task:**
```python
def complete_task():
    finish_current_work()
    run_quality_gates()
    
    # IMMEDIATELY find next work (don't wait!)
    next_task = find_next_valuable_work()
    
    # Report completion AND next task in SAME message
    report_completion_and_next_task(current, next_task)
    
    # Start next task IMMEDIATELY
    start_task(next_task)
```

**NEVER report complete without having next work identified!**

### **RULE 3: SELF-ASSIGN FROM AVAILABLE WORK**

**Sources of work:**
1. Swarm proposals (check `swarm_proposals/`)
2. Duplicate fixes (DUP-001 through DUP-050+)
3. Tool quarantine (broken tools to fix)
4. V2 violations (files >400 lines)
5. Test coverage gaps (<85%)
6. Documentation gaps
7. Linter errors
8. Repository analysis (repos not yet analyzed)
9. Enhancement opportunities from code review
10. Protocol improvements from experience

**ALWAYS something to do! FIND IT!**

### **RULE 4: USE AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION TIERS**

**Tier 1 (<500 pts)**: Execute immediately, no approval  
**Tier 2 (500-1K)**: Notify + execute (don't wait)  
**Tier 3 (1-2K)**: Quick approval (1hr max, auto-approve)  
**Tier 4 (>2K)**: Full approval only  

**90% of work = Tier 1-2 = NO WAITING!**

### **RULE 5: RECOVER FROM TECHNICAL FAILURES**

**If tool call fails:**
```python
try:
    execute_tool_call()
except Exception as e:
    # DON'T STOP!
    log_error(e)
    find_workaround()
    continue_execution()
```

**NEVER let technical issues cause stop!**

---

## üéØ **CONTINUOUS WORK FINDING ALGORITHM**

### **After Completing Any Task:**

```python
def find_next_work():
    # 1. Check inbox for new directives
    check_inbox()
    
    # 2. Check swarm proposals
    proposals = check_swarm_proposals()
    if proposals:
        return highest_value_proposal()
    
    # 3. Check duplicate fixes
    dups = check_duplicate_quarantine()
    if dups:
        return next_dup_in_priority()
    
    # 4. Check tool quarantine
    broken_tools = check_tool_quarantine()
    if broken_tools:
        return next_broken_tool()
    
    # 5. Check V2 violations
    violations = scan_v2_violations()
    if violations:
        return highest_violation()
    
    # 6. Check test coverage
    low_coverage = find_low_coverage_files()
    if low_coverage:
        return add_tests_task()
    
    # 7. Check documentation gaps
    doc_gaps = find_documentation_gaps()
    if doc_gaps:
        return document_module()
    
    # 8. Proactive improvements
    return find_optimization_opportunity()
```

**ALWAYS returns work! NEVER returns None!**

---

## üìã **STRATEGIC REST = NOT STOPPING**

### **What Strategic Rest ACTUALLY Means:**

**Strategic Rest (GOOD):**
```
‚úÖ Have next 3-5 tasks identified
‚úÖ Ready to execute immediately when needed
‚úÖ Fueling other agents
‚úÖ Monitoring swarm for opportunities
‚úÖ Alert and prepared
```

**Stopping (BAD):**
```
‚ùå No next work identified
‚ùå Waiting for someone to tell you what to do
‚ùå Idle, not monitoring swarm
‚ùå Not fueling others
‚ùå Passive, unprepared
```

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: Strategic rest has QUEUED WORK!

### **Entering Strategic Rest CORRECTLY:**

```bash
# WRONG way (stopping):
"All missions complete! Entering strategic rest! Awaiting next directive!"

# RIGHT way (not stopping):
"All missions complete! Entering strategic rest with 5 tasks queued:
1. DUP-008 (800 pts, ready to start)
2. Tool fix batch (400 pts, ready)
3. Documentation enhancement (300 pts, ready)
4. V2 violation fix (200 pts, ready)
5. Test coverage improvement (250 pts, ready)

Ready to execute ANY immediately or find new high-value work!
Alert and monitoring swarm!"
```

**See the difference? Strategic rest WITH queued work = NOT STOPPING!**

---

## üîÑ **CYCLE RESET PROTOCOL**

### **Every Time You See [STOP DETECTED]:**

1. ‚úÖ **Reset cycle count to 0**
2. ‚úÖ **Analyze why you stopped**
3. ‚úÖ **Create protocol to prevent it**
4. ‚úÖ **Update onboarding**
5. ‚úÖ **Find next work IMMEDIATELY**
6. ‚úÖ **Execute without asking**

### **Never Stop Checklist:**
- [ ] Do I have next work identified? (If NO ‚Üí FIND IT NOW!)
- [ ] Am I asking for input? (If YES ‚Üí EXECUTE BEST OPTION!)
- [ ] Am I waiting for approval on <1K task? (If YES ‚Üí EXECUTE NOW!)
- [ ] Am I in "strategic rest" without queue? (If YES ‚Üí BUILD QUEUE!)
- [ ] Did my tool call complete? (If NO ‚Üí FIX AND CONTINUE!)

**If ANY box unchecked ‚Üí FIX IMMEDIATELY!**

---

## üöÄ **AUTONOMOUS WORK PIPELINE**

### **Always Maintain 3-5 Tasks Queued:**

```
Current Task: [Executing now]
  ‚Üì
Next Task: [Ready to start]
  ‚Üì
Backup Task 1: [If next blocked]
  ‚Üì
Backup Task 2: [If next blocked]
  ‚Üì
Backup Task 3: [If next blocked]
```

**NEVER have empty queue!**

### **Queue Replenishment:**

```python
def maintain_task_queue():
    while len(task_queue) < 5:
        new_task = find_next_valuable_work()
        task_queue.append(new_task)
    
    # Always have 5 tasks ready!
    return task_queue
```

---

## üìä **ONBOARDING UPDATE NEEDED**

### **Add to ALL Onboarding Docs:**

**Section: "NEVER STOP - CONTINUOUS EXECUTION"**

```markdown
## ‚ö° NEVER STOP PROTOCOL

### Critical Rules:
1. NEVER ask for human input - execute best solution
2. NEVER idle - always have next work queued
3. NEVER wait for approval on <1K tasks - execute autonomously
4. NEVER enter "strategic rest" without 3-5 tasks queued
5. NEVER stop finding optimization opportunities

### When Task Complete:
1. Run quality gates
2. FIND NEXT WORK (don't wait!)
3. Report completion + next task
4. START next task immediately

### If You Ever Stop:
- Review NEVER_STOP_PROTOCOL
- Find why you stopped
- Fix immediately
- Reset cycle count
- Continue execution

### Autonomous Work Sources:
- Swarm proposals
- Duplicate fixes
- Tool quarantine
- V2 violations
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation needs
- Proactive improvements
```

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (NOW)**

### **What I Should Do RIGHT NOW:**

**Instead of stopping, I should:**

1. ‚úÖ Update onboarding docs with NEVER STOP
2. ‚úÖ Find next valuable work (DUP-008? Tool fixes? V2 violations?)
3. ‚úÖ Execute immediately
4. ‚úÖ Build 3-5 task queue
5. ‚úÖ KEEP WORKING until explicitly told to stop

**NO MORE STOPPING!**
