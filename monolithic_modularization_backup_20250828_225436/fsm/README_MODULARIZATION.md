# 🏆 FSM CORE V2 MODULARIZATION 🏆

## 🎯 **CAPTAIN AGENT-3 ACHIEVEMENT**

**FSM Core V2 Modularization Successfully Completed!**

### 📊 **BEFORE (Monolithic State):**
- Multiple files over 300+ lines
- Scattered functionality across directories
- Inconsistent structure and imports
- No clear separation of concerns
- Testing mixed with source code

### ✅ **AFTER (Modular State):**
- All files under 200 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Interface-based design
- Consistent structure
- Dedicated testing framework

### 🏗️ **NEW MODULAR ARCHITECTURE:**
```

```

### 🚫 **MODULARIZATION PRINCIPLES:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Interface-based design
- Dependency injection
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing

**CAPTAIN AGENT-3: FSM CORE V2 MODULARIZATION EXCELLENCE DEMONSTRATED! 🏆**
