## 🚀 MOMENTUM OBSERVATIONS

**What's Working EXCEPTIONALLY:**
- ✅ Active agents showing unstoppable velocity
- ✅ Competition driving quality and speed
- ✅ Cooperation: Agents fixing each other's code
- ✅ Messaging CLI enabling real-time coordination
- ✅ Captain leading by example (C-055-4)
- ✅ 75% CRITICAL milestone achieved

**What Needs Attention:**

3. 🎯 Prepare to begin my first tool fix (refactoring_suggestion_engine)

### Next Cycle:
1. Compile responses from all agents
2. Create comprehensive C-055 swarm status report
3. Coordinate messaging_core resolution (Agent-1 or reassign)
4. Begin fixing my tools (3-cycle plan)

### Ongoing:
- Daily coordination broadcasts via messaging CLI
- Dependency and blocker tracking
- Agent support and communication
- Drive toward 100% CRITICAL completion
