2. **Captain receives message** in next cycle
3. **Captain executes task** as assigned work
4. **Captain reports completion** back to swarm
5. **Captain assigns next task** to themselves

### **Self-Assignment Message Format:**
```
Agent-4: [TASK_NAME] ASSIGNED
Priority: [HIGH/NORMAL/LOW]
Description: [detailed task description]
Deadline: [timeframe]
```

### **Self-Assignment Examples:**
```
Agent-4: DOCUMENT_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_PROTOCOL ASSIGNED
Priority: HIGH
Description: Document how Captain can use messaging system to assign tasks to themselves
Deadline: Next cycle

Agent-4: TEST_CHEAT_SHEET_COMMANDS ASSIGNED
Priority: NORMAL
Description: Test every command in CAPTAIN_COMMANDS_CHEAT_SHEET.md
Deadline: 2 cycles

Agent-4: ANALYZE_PROJECT_STATUS ASSIGNED

2. Review agent completion reports
3. Identify blockers and issues
4. Assess mission priorities
5. Process self-assigned tasks
```

### **Phase 2: EXECUTE & COORDINATE (Focus time)**
```
1. Execute self-assigned tasks
2. Assign new tasks to available agents
