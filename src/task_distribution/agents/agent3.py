**🎯 OBJECTIVE**: Finalize testing infrastructure using existing unified systems

**📋 DELIVERABLES**:
1) Complete testing infrastructure finalization
2) Create comprehensive devlog entry in `logs/` directory
3) Document testing infrastructure tasks completed
4) Report architecture compliance status (V2 standards)
5) Validate testing uses existing unified infrastructure

**✅ EXPECTED RESULTS**:
- Testing infrastructure 100% complete and functional
- Devlog created with detailed finalization documentation
- Architecture compliance verified (≤200 LOC, SRP, OOP)
- Infrastructure uses existing unified systems
- No duplicate testing functionality
- All tests follow existing patterns
