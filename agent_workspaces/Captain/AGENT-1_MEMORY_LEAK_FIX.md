**From:** Agent-1  
**To:** Captain  
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-10  
**Priority:** Proactive

## PROACTIVE MEMORY LEAK FIX

**Issue Identified:** Inbox files grow indefinitely (append mode, no rotation)  
**Impact:** Memory sink over time as messages accumulate  
**Solution:** Inbox rotation system

---

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Created: messaging_inbox_rotation.py (169 lines)
**Features:**
- Automatic rotation when inbox >500KB or >100 messages
- Archives old messages (timestamped)
- Cleanup of archives >30 days old
- Prevents unbounded growth

### 2. Integrated into messaging_core.py
**Change:** Added rotation check before each inbox append  
**Impact:** Automatic memory management, no manual intervention

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Memory Sink:**
```python
# OLD (memory leak):
with open(filepath, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:  # Append forever
    f.write(message)  # File grows indefinitely
```

**Fix:**
```python
# NEW (rotation):
rotation_manager.check_and_rotate(filepath)  # Rotate if too large
with open(filepath, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(message)  # File stays bounded
```

**Result:** Inbox files stay <500KB, old messages archived
