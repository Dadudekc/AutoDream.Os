# ü§ñ Agent Roles and Responsibilities - PHASE 2 STRUCTURE

## Overview
This document outlines the **CURRENT PHASE 2** roles and responsibilities for all agents in the Agent Cellphone V2 system.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: These are the CURRENT Phase 2 roles, NOT the old V1 roles. All agents must understand their actual current assignments.

## Agent Specializations - PHASE 2

### Agent-1: Integration & Core Systems
- **Focus**: Workflow engine integration, health systems, task scheduling
- **Current Active Tasks**: 
  - TASK 1B: Workflow Engine Integration (2-3 hours)
  - TASK 1C: Health System Consolidation (1-2 hours)
  - TASK 1D: Task Scheduler Consolidation (2-3 hours)
- **Total Workload**: 5-8 hours of continuous development
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - System integration and consolidation
  - Health monitoring systems
  - Task scheduling and management
  - Core workflow engine development

### Agent-2: Manager Specialization
- **Focus**: Manager patterns, status systems, decision systems, scaling
- **Current Active Tasks**:
  - TASK 2: Manager Specialization (2-3 hours)
  - TASK 2A: Status Manager Consolidation (2-3 hours)
  - TASK 2B: Decision System Consolidation (2-3 hours)
  - TASK 2C: Scaling System Consolidation (2-3 hours)
- **Total Workload**: 8-12 hours of continuous development
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manager pattern implementation
  - Status system consolidation
  - Decision system unification
  - Scaling system optimization

### Agent-3: Integration & Testing
- **Focus**: System integration, workspace systems, performance systems
- **Current Active Tasks**:
  - TASK 3: Integration & Testing (1-2 hours)
  - TASK 3A: Workspace System Consolidation (2-3 hours)
  - TASK 3B: Performance System Consolidation (3-4 hours)
- **Total Workload**: 6-9 hours of continuous development
- **Responsibilities**:
  - System integration and testing
  - Workspace system consolidation
  - Performance system optimization
  - Cross-system coordination

### Agent-4: Coordination & Phase 3 Preparation
- **Focus**: System coordination, contract management, progress tracking
- **Current Active Tasks**:
  - TASK 4: Coordination & Phase 3 Preparation (ongoing)
  - TASK 4A: Coordination System Consolidation (2-3 hours)
- **Total Workload**: 2-3 hours + ongoing coordination
- **Responsibilities**:
  - System coordination and management
  - Contract distribution and tracking
  - Progress monitoring and reporting
  - Phase 3 preparation and planning

## Phase 2 Architecture Focus

### **Current Mission**: Workflow Systems Unification
- **Goal**: Consolidate all workflow systems into unified architecture
- **Timeline**: End-of-week completion target
- **Status**: üîÑ **ACTIVE WORKFLOW** - 16 contracts distributed

### **Key Principles**:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each agent has focused, clear purpose
- **V2 Standards**: Follow BaseManager inheritance, clean architecture
- **Continuous Workflow**: Multiple contracts per agent, no idle time
- **Architecture Compliance**: 100% V2 standards adherence

## General Responsibilities - PHASE 2
- **Execute Active Contracts**: Complete all assigned Phase 2 tasks
- **Create Devlogs**: Document progress in `logs/` directory
- **Report Progress**: Status updates every 2 hours via PyAutoGUI
- **Request Next Contracts**: Ask for additional work when ready
- **Maintain Architecture Compliance**: Follow V2 standards strictly
- **Collaborate with Other Agents**: Coordinate on system integration tasks

## Role Verification

### **Before Starting Work**:
1. **Verify Current Role**: Check this document for your actual Phase 2 role
2. **Check Active Tasks**: Review your current contract assignments
3. **Understand Responsibilities**: Know what you're actually supposed to do
4. **Report Role Confusion**: If you think you have the wrong role, ask immediately

### **Common Role Confusions to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå **Agent-3**: NOT multimedia/content - you are integration/testing
- ‚ùå **Agent-4**: NOT security/infrastructure - you are coordination/planning
- ‚ùå **Agent-1**: NOT foundation/testing - you are integration/core systems
- ‚ùå **Agent-2**: NOT AI/ML - you are manager specialization

## Phase 2 Success Metrics
- **Contract Completion**: 100% of assigned tasks completed
- **Architecture Compliance**: All work follows V2 standards
- **Devlog Creation**: Every task documented in `logs/` directory
- **Continuous Workflow**: No idle time, always have active contracts
- **System Unification**: All workflow systems consolidated and unified

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: If you're reading this and think you have the wrong role, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask for clarification. Working on the wrong tasks wastes time and delays Phase 2 completion.
