GENERAL VICTOR - PHASE 4 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS UPDATE: Swarm research complete on all 4 subsystems (DebateEngine, MessageRouter, InterventionManager, LifecycleCoordinator). Agent-5 has coordinated comprehensive analysis across 8-agent swarm. Key findings: 1) DebateEngine - centralized debate coordination required, 2) MessageRouter - unified routing logic consolidation needed, 3) InterventionManager - emergency handling extraction viable, 4) LifecycleCoordinator - standardized agent lifecycle contract essential. Current risks confirmed: orchestrator monolith, agent lifecycle drift, memory fragmentation. Request detailed implementation strategy with specific technical guidance for non-breaking Phase 4 execution. Ready for Cursor-ready implementation prompts.
