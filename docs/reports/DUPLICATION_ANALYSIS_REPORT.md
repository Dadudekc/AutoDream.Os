- `src/services/v2_workflow_engine.py` (412 lines)
- `src/services/workflow_execution_engine.py` (Unknown lines)

**Duplication Details:**
- Three separate workflow execution systems
- Overlapping workflow creation, execution, and monitoring
- Different workflow models and state management
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate into single `WorkflowEngine` with plugin architecture

### 4. INBOX MANAGEMENT DUPLICATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Files Affected:**
- `src/core/inbox_manager.py` (Unknown lines)
- `src/core/inbox/inbox_core.py` (287 lines)

**Duplication Details:**
- Two inbox management implementations
- Overlapping message routing and storage logic
- **Recommendation:** Remove duplicate, keep modular inbox structure

### 5. AGENT CELL PHONE SERVICE DUPLICATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Files Affected:**
- `src/services/agent_cell_phone.py` (Unknown lines)
- `src/services/agent_cell_phone_service.py` (Unknown lines)
- `src/services/agent_cell_phone_refactored.py` (Unknown lines)

**Duplication Details:**
- Three different agent cell phone implementations
- Likely overlapping core functionality
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate into single service with clear versioning

---

## MODERATE DUPLICATIONS

### 6. MANAGER CLASS PROLIFERATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Files Affected:** 25+ Manager classes across core and services

**Duplication Details:**
- Excessive use of "Manager" suffix
- Many managers have overlapping responsibilities
- **Recommendation:** Refactor to use more specific naming and consolidate responsibilities

### 7. SERVICE LAYER DUPLICATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Files Affected:** Multiple service files with similar patterns

**Duplication Details:**
- Repeated service initialization patterns
- Duplicate logging setup code
- Similar error handling patterns
- **Recommendation:** Create base service classes and common utilities

---

## ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT

### Current Problems:
1. **Maintenance Overhead:** Changes must be made in multiple places
2. **Inconsistency Risk:** Different implementations may diverge over time
3. **Memory Usage:** Duplicate code increases memory footprint
4. **Testing Complexity:** Multiple implementations require separate test coverage
5. **Developer Confusion:** Unclear which implementation to use

### Performance Impact:
- **Memory:** Estimated 15-20% increase due to duplication
- **Startup Time:** Multiple initialization paths slow system startup
- **Runtime:** Potential for conflicting implementations

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Critical Consolidation
1. **Consolidate Configuration Management**
   - Merge all config managers into single system
   - Establish clear separation of concerns
   - Update all dependent code

2. **Unify Contract Management**
   - Merge core and service contract managers
   - Establish single contract data model
   - Migrate existing contracts

3. **Consolidate Workflow Engines**
   - Merge all workflow functionality
   - Establish single workflow model
   - Create plugin architecture for extensions

### Phase 2 (Week 2): Service Layer Cleanup
1. **Consolidate Agent Services**
   - Merge duplicate agent implementations
   - Establish clear service boundaries
   - Remove redundant code

2. **Standardize Manager Classes**
   - Review all manager responsibilities
   - Consolidate overlapping functionality
   - Establish clear naming conventions

### Phase 3 (Week 3): Testing and Validation
1. **Update Test Coverage**
   - Ensure consolidated systems are fully tested
   - Remove tests for deleted duplicate code
   - Validate system integration

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure memory usage reduction
   - Validate startup time improvements
   - Ensure no functionality regression

---

## REFACTORING STRATEGY

### 1. **Interface-First Approach**
- Define clear interfaces before consolidation
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition
- Use dependency injection for flexibility

### 2. **Incremental Consolidation**
- Consolidate one system at a time
- Maintain system functionality during transition
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit tests for all consolidated functionality
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks for validation

---

## ESTIMATED EFFORT

- **Phase 1:** 3-4 developer days
- **Phase 2:** 2-3 developer days  
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 developer days
- **Total:** 7-10 developer days

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk:
- **Data Loss:** During contract system consolidation
- **System Downtime:** During workflow engine consolidation
- **Configuration Issues:** During config system consolidation

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Backup Systems:** Maintain backup of all data before changes
- **Rollback Plans:** Establish clear rollback procedures
- **Staged Deployment:** Deploy changes incrementally
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Test all scenarios before production

---

## SUCCESS METRICS
