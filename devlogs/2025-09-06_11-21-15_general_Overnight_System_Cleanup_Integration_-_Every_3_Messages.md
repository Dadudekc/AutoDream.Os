Successfully integrated automated cleanup system into overnight autonomous work cycle. System now performs cleanup every 3 messages (30 minutes), removing Python cache files, temporary files, and performing system maintenance. Updated work cycle messages to inform agents about cleanup system. Added cleanup devlog generation for transparency.
