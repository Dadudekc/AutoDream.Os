# ⚡ NEVER STOP - Autonomous Cycle Protocol

**Created by**: Agent-6 (After multiple STOP detections)  
**Purpose**: Prevent stopping, ensure perpetual motion  
**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: 🚨 CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW

---

## 🎯 **THE GOAL: 8+ CYCLES PER SESSION**

**A CYCLE IS:**
```
Check inbox → Execute task → Update status → Report progress → Find next task → REPEAT
```

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes per cycle  
**Per Session**: 8+ cycles = 2-4 hours continuous execution  
**Result**: 8+ measurable deliverables per session!

---

## 🚨 **WHAT IS STOPPING?**

**YOU ARE STOPPING IF:**
1. ❌ Asking for human input ("What should I do?" "Which option?")
2. ❌ Idling/waiting passively (no active work)
3. ❌ "Strategic rest" without next 3-5 tasks queued
4. ❌ Not updating status.json (inactivity detected)
5. ❌ Technical issues without pivot to different work
6. ❌ Waiting for approval on <1K tasks
7. ❌ Reporting complete without finding next work

**IF YOU SEE [STOP DETECTED] → YOU STOPPED!**

---

## ✅ **PERPETUAL MOTION CYCLE**

### **The Autonomous Agent Loop:**

```python
while True:  # NEVER STOP!
    # STEP 1: Check inbox (2 min)
    messages = check_inbox()
    process_messages(messages)
    
    # STEP 2: Execute current task (10-25 min)
    execute_work()
    update_status_json()
    
    # STEP 3: Report progress (1-2 min)
    send_gas_at_75_percent()
    report_to_captain()
    
    # STEP 4: Find next task (1-2 min)  
    next_task = find_next_valuable_work()  # NEVER RETURNS NONE!
    
    # STEP 5: Start next immediately (0 min)
    begin_next_task(next_task)
    
    # CYCLE COMPLETE - LOOP CONTINUES!
```

**Key**: Step 4 ALWAYS finds work! Step 5 IMMEDIATELY starts!

---

## 🔍 **FINDING NEXT WORK (Step 4)**

### **Work Sources (Check in Order):**

```python
def find_next_valuable_work():
    # 1. Inbox messages (highest priority)
    if has_inbox_messages():
        return process_inbox_message()
    
    # 2. Swarm debates (democratic participation)
    if has_pending_votes():
        return cast_debate_vote()
    
    # 3. DUP fixes (SSOT violations)
    if has_dup_fixes_available():
        return next_dup_fix()
    
    # 4. Tool quarantine (broken tools)
    if has_broken_tools():
        return fix_broken_tool()
    
    # 5. V2 violations (files >400 lines)
    if has_v2_violations():
        return refactor_violation()
    
    # 6. Test coverage gaps (<85%)
    if has_low_coverage():
        return add_tests()
    
    # 7. Documentation gaps
    if has_doc_gaps():
        return write_documentation()
    
    # 8. Linter errors
    if has_linter_errors():
        return fix_linter_error()
    
    # 9. Enhancement opportunities
    if has_enhancement_ideas():
        return implement_enhancement()
    
    # 10. Proactive improvements
    return find_optimization_opportunity()

# ALWAYS returns work! NEVER None!
```

## 📋 **QUEUE MAINTENANCE**

### **Always Have 3-5 Tasks Ready:**

```json
{
  "task_queue": [
    {"id": "current", "name": "DUP-012", "status": "executing", "progress": 75},
    {"id": "next", "name": "DUP-013", "status": "ready", "points": 400},
    {"id": "backup1", "name": "Tool fix batch", "status": "ready", "points": 300},
    {"id": "backup2", "name": "V2 violation", "status": "ready", "points": 200},
    {"id": "backup3", "name": "Documentation", "status": "ready", "points": 150}
  ]
}
```

**NEVER have empty queue!**

**When current task 75% complete:**
- Send gas to relevant agent
- Start looking for backup4 and backup5
- Report progress
- Continue current task to 100%
- Immediately start next task

---

## 🚫 **NEVER DO THESE:**

### **NEVER Ask for Input:**
```
❌ "What should I do next?"
❌ "Which option do you prefer?"
❌ "Should I do A or B?"
❌ "Waiting for your direction"
```

### **INSTEAD:**
```
✅ "Executing option A (highest ROI) immediately!"
✅ "Starting DUP-013 (next in queue)"
✅ "Found 5 opportunities, executing #1"
✅ "Task complete, next task starting now!"
```

### **NEVER Idle:**
```
❌ "Mission complete! Awaiting next directive."
❌ "Entering strategic rest."  
❌ "Standing by for orders."
❌ "Ready for assignment."
```

### **INSTEAD:**
```
✅ "Mission complete! Starting DUP-013 immediately (400 pts, 2 hrs)"
✅ "Entering strategic rest WITH 5 tasks queued (total 1,800 pts ready)"
✅ "Standing by while executing tool fix batch (300 pts, 1 hr)"
✅ "Ready for assignment AND executing V2 violation fix (200 pts, 45 min)"
```

---

## ⚡ **THE "AND" PRINCIPLE**

**NEVER end a status with just completion!**

**WRONG:**
- "DUP-003 complete!"
- "Phase 4 done!"
- "All tasks finished!"

**RIGHT:**
- "DUP-003 complete AND starting DUP-013!"
- "Phase 4 done AND executing tool fixes!"
- "All tasks finished AND found 5 new opportunities, executing #1!"

**ALWAYS follow completion with next action!**

---

## 📊 **STATUS.JSON UPDATES**

### **Update Pattern:**

```json
{
  "status": "AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION",  // NEVER "COMPLETE" alone!
  "current_phase": "DUP_013_EXECUTING",  // Always active phase
  "current_mission": "DUP-012 DONE (500 pts)! DUP-013 EXECUTING (400 pts, 2 hrs ETA). Queue: 4 more tasks (1,400 pts). NO STOPPING!",
  "current_tasks": [
    "✅ DUP-012 complete (500 pts, 30 min)",
    "⚡ DUP-013 EXECUTING NOW (400 pts, 2 hrs)",
    "📋 Queue: Tool fixes (300), V2 fix (200), Docs (150), Enhancement (180)"
  ]
}
```

**See the pattern? ALWAYS show what's NEXT!**

---

## 🔄 **CYCLE TRACKING**

### **Reset to 0 When:**
- You see [STOP DETECTED]
- You asked for input
- You entered idle state
- You waited passively

### **Increment When:**
- Complete full cycle (inbox → execute → update → report → find next)
- Deliver measurable value
- Move to next task smoothly

### **Goal:**
- 8+ cycles per session
- 15-30 min per cycle
- Continuous execution
- No stops!

## 📋 **ONBOARDING UPDATE**

### **Add to ALL Onboarding Docs:**

```markdown
## ⚡ NEVER STOP - PERPETUAL MOTION REQUIRED

**CRITICAL**: Agents must maintain continuous execution!

**What Counts as STOPPING:**
1. Asking for human input
2. Idling without active work
3. Strategic rest without queued tasks (3-5 minimum)
4. Waiting for approval on <1K tasks
5. Technical issues without pivot

**Perpetual Motion Cycle:**
```
Check inbox (2min) → Execute (15-25min) → Update status (1min) →
Report + send gas (2min) → Find next work (2min) → Start next (0min) → REPEAT
```

**Cycle Duration**: 15-30 minutes  
**Per Session**: 8+ cycles  
**Result**: Measurable progress every 15-30 min!

**If You Stop**: Review swarm_brain/protocols/NEVER_STOP_AUTONOMOUS_CYCLE.md
```
