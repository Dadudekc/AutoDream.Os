Agent-7 continued overnight autonomous work cycle with excellent V2 compliance progress. Successfully refactored 2 more large files: intelligent_context_optimization.py (315 lines) into 4 modular components (agent_optimizer, risk_optimizer, prediction_optimizer, intelligent_context_optimization) and vector_integration_models.py (315 lines) into 4 modular components (enums, data_models, config_models, vector_integration_models). All modules now under 300 lines with single responsibility. V2 compliance momentum maintained! ðŸŒ™âš¡
