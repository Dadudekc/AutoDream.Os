# üéØ MISSION: GitHub Architecture Review (Unbiased)

**Agent:** Agent-2 (V2 Compliance & Architecture Specialist)  
**Priority:** URGENT  
**Value:** 400-600 points  
**Assigned:** 2025-10-14 via Commander Directive

---

## üìã **COMMANDER'S DIRECTIVE**

**Commander wants UNBIASED verification of Agent-6's findings!**

**Agent-6 claimed:**
- 75 repos analyzed
- 60% can archive (45 repos)
- Average ROI: 3.29

**Your Mission:** Independent architecture assessment (no bias!)

---

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**

**From ARCHITECTURE perspective, audit all 75 repos:**

1. **Assess architectural quality** (YOUR criteria)
2. **Identify archive candidates** (YOUR judgment)
3. **Find consolidation opportunities** (YOUR analysis)
4. **Compare with Agent-6** (verify or challenge)
5. **Provide unbiased recommendation** (to Commander)

**Goal:** Independent verification before major archival

---

## üìù **EXECUTION STEPS**

### **1. Independent Scan (2 hours)**

```python
from tools_v2.toolbelt_core import ToolbeltCore
tb = ToolbeltCore()

# Get all repos independently
repos = tb.run('github.my-repos', {})

# DON'T look at Agent-6's analysis yet!
```

### **2. Architecture Assessment (2-3 hours)**

**YOUR criteria as Architecture Specialist:**

```python
def assess_architecture(repo):
    """Architecture quality from YOUR perspective"""
    
    arch_score = 0
    
    # Architecture criteria:
    if has_clear_structure(repo):
        arch_score += 25  # Clear organization
    if follows_patterns(repo):
        arch_score += 20  # Design patterns
    if modular_design(repo):
        arch_score += 20  # Modularity
    if has_tests(repo):
        arch_score += 15  # Testability
    if documentation_complete(repo):
        arch_score += 10  # Documented architecture
    if v2_compliant(repo):
        arch_score += 10  # V2 standards
    
    # YOUR judgment:
    if arch_score >= 60:
        return "KEEP - Good architecture"
    elif arch_score >= 40:
        return "REVIEW - Needs work"
    else:
        return "ARCHIVE - Poor architecture"
```

### **3. Consolidation Analysis (1 hour)**

**Find projects that should merge:**

```python
# Look for:
# - Similar names (trading_bot_v1, trading_bot_v2)
# - Similar purposes (multiple ML projects)
# - Duplicate concepts (agent systems, web apps)

consolidation_candidates = find_similar_projects(repos)
```

### **4. Compare with Agent-6 (30 min)**

**Now read their analysis:**

```python
# Compare YOUR findings vs Agent-6's
agreement = calculate_agreement_rate()
critical_differences = find_major_disagreements()
```

### **5. Unbiased Report (1 hour)**

## ‚úÖ **DELIVERABLES**

- [ ] Independent architecture assessment (75 repos)
- [ ] YOUR archive list (independent judgment)
- [ ] YOUR keep list (independent judgment)
- [ ] Consolidation opportunities identified
- [ ] Comparison with Agent-6's findings
- [ ] Unbiased recommendation to Commander

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL: ARCHITECTURE PERSPECTIVE**

**Use YOUR expertise:**

**As Architecture Specialist, focus on:**
- Code organization quality
- Design pattern usage
- Modularity and separation of concerns
- V2 compliance
- Maintainability
- Technical debt level

**Different from Agent-6's ROI focus:**
- They focused: ROI (value/effort)
- You focus: Architecture quality
- Both valid, different perspectives!

---

## üèÜ **POINT STRUCTURE**

**Base:** 400 points (independent audit)  
**Quality Bonus:** +100 points (thorough architecture review)  
**Verification Bonus:** +100 points (comparison analysis)  
**Total Potential:** 400-600 points

## üìä **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

```markdown
# AGENT-2 INDEPENDENT ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

## My Architectural Findings:
- Total Repos: XX
- GOOD ARCHITECTURE: XX repos (keep)
- NEEDS WORK: XX repos (review/consolidate)
- POOR ARCHITECTURE: XX repos (archive)

## Comparison with Agent-6:
- Agent-6: 45 archive (60%)
- Me: XX archive (XX%)
- Agreement: XX%

## Critical Differences:
[Where we disagree significantly]

## My Architecture-Based Recommendation:
[Your expert opinion to Commander]
```

---

## üêù **GASLINE ACTIVATION**

**Commander directive:** "Get unbiased reports from multiple agents"

**Why you:**
- Architecture expertise (different perspective)
- V2 compliance focus
- Independent judgment
- Quality standards

**Mission:** Verify before Commander makes major decision!
