## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Risk #1: Agent-2 Bottleneck**
**Issue:** Agent-2 on critical path for 115 hours  
**Mitigation:**
- Distribute architecture work to Agent-1 (integration specialist)
- Agent-5 can handle ML independently after initial design
- Schedule Agent-2's critical work first (weeks 1-4, 7-9)

### **Risk #2: DreamVault Scope Creep**
**Issue:** 160-200hr for DreamVault could expand  
**Mitigation:**
- Strict scope control (5 agents, no extras)
- Quick Wins first (20hr for IP + Summarization)
- Can defer full integration if needed

### **Risk #3: Integration Conflicts**
**Issue:** Multiple systems touching same code  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear module boundaries
- Agent-8 (SSOT) coordinates configuration
- Code reviews before merge

### **Risk #4: Testing Overhead**
**Issue:** New systems need comprehensive testing  
**Mitigation:**
- Testing built into each phase
- Agent-6 coordinates test efforts
- Automated testing where possible
