## 📊 Overcomplexity Elimination Targets

### ✅ File Size Reduction Targets:
- **Current Files:** ✅ 300-400 lines per file
- **Target Reduction:** ✅ 300-400 lines per file
- **Final Size:** ✅ ≤400 lines (V2 compliant)
- **Elimination Method:** ✅ Remove overcomplexity, not refactor

### ✅ Specific Elimination Areas:
1. **Excessive Enums (5+ per file):**
   - Remove redundant enum definitions
   - Consolidate similar enums
   - Use simple constants where appropriate
   - Eliminate over-engineered enum hierarchies

2. **Complex Dataclass Hierarchies:**
   - Simplify dataclass inheritance
   - Remove unnecessary nested structures
   - Use simple data structures where possible
   - Eliminate over-engineered data models

3. **Redundant ABCs:**
   - Remove unnecessary abstract base classes
   - Use simple interfaces where appropriate
   - Eliminate over-engineered inheritance hierarchies
   - Simplify class structures

4. **Unnecessary Async Operations:**
   - Remove async where not needed
   - Simplify async patterns
   - Use synchronous operations where appropriate
   - Eliminate over-engineered async hierarchies

5. **Overengineered Event Systems:**
   - Simplify event handling
   - Remove unnecessary event abstractions
   - Use simple callbacks where appropriate
   - Eliminate over-engineered event hierarchies

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### ✅ Overcomplexity Elimination Process:
1. **Identify Overcomplexity:** ✅ Analyze files for excessive complexity
2. **Prioritize Elimination:** ✅ Focus on highest impact simplifications
3. **Remove Redundancy:** ✅ Eliminate duplicate or unnecessary code
4. **Simplify Structures:** ✅ Streamline complex hierarchies
5. **Validate V2 Compliance:** ✅ Ensure files meet line count requirements
6. **Test Functionality:** ✅ Verify simplified code works correctly
