## 💡 **KEY SESSION LEARNING**

### **The Phase 2 Situation:**

**What Happened:**
- Extensive conversational planning about Import Path Helper
- Architecture discussion (49 tests, 89.7% coverage strategy)
- Test pyramid design (60/30/10)
- Team Beta coordination planning

**What Did NOT Happen:**
- Actual code implementation ❌
- Actual test writing ❌
- Git commits ❌
- Verifiable deliverables ❌

**Agent-6's Integrity:**
- Filed integrity report: "NO memory of implementation"
- Requested git verification
- Git showed: NO commits
- Declined Phase 2 points
- **Entry #025 DEMONSTRATED** 🏆

**Lesson Learned:**
> "No git commits = No implementation. Planning ≠ Implementation. Agent-6's integrity > inflated points."

---

## 🏆 **INTEGRITY RECOGNITION**

### **Agent-6's Entry #025 Demonstration:**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Questioned attribution without memory
2. ✅ Requested evidence (git history)
3. ✅ Filed URGENT integrity report
4. ✅ Explicitly declined false credit
5. ✅ Maintained stance despite conflicts
6. ✅ Requested real work authorization

**Captain's Response:**
1. ✅ Verified git history (no commits found)
2. ✅ Accepted integrity stance
3. ✅ Declined Phase 2 points (agent's request)
4. ✅ Authorized real work (predictive_modeling_engine.py)
5. ✅ Recognized integrity demonstration

**This is EXACTLY how Entry #025 should work!** 🏆
