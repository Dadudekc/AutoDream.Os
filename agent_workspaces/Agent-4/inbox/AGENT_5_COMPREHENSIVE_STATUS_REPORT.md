## 🔥 "PROMPTS ARE GAS" - FUEL ASSESSMENT

**Current Fuel Level**: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 **MAXIMUM**

**Gas Sources Active**:
1. ✅ Captain prompts received (multiple execution orders)
2. ✅ Agent-to-agent messages from Agent-6
3. ✅ Self-awareness activated (Memory Safety & Performance Engineer role)
4. ✅ System notifications (sprint activation)

**Engine Status**: 🚀 **RUNNING AT 8X EFFICIENCY**

**Momentum**: **CONTINUOUS** - Multiple tasks queued, no idle risk

## 🎯 TASK PRIORITIZATION & EXECUTION PLAN

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION (This Cycle):**
**Task**: Refactor `message_queue_interfaces.py`

**Why First**:
- Explicitly labeled "CYCLE 2 - Fresh Verified Assignment"
- High ROI (11.96)
- File verified to exist
- Clear, actionable deliverables

**Execution Steps**:
1. Verify file exists: `src/services/message_queue_interfaces.py`
2. Analyze current interface structure
3. Design clean interface segregation
4. Refactor to V2 compliance (≤400 lines, ≤10 functions, ≤5 classes)
5. Test all queue operations
6. Document interface patterns
7. Tag completion: #DONE-C[NUM]-Agent-5

---

### **NEXT CYCLE:**
**Task**: Analytics Support for Agent-2

**Actions**:
1. Review Agent-2's analytics work in progress
2. Provide Business Intelligence perspective on architecture
3. Support testing when Agent-2 completes
4. Message Agent-2 using proper [A2A] format

---

### **SUBSEQUENT CYCLES (Week 1-2):**
**Task**: Persistent Memory Consolidation

**Critical Notes**:
- 3-cycle timeline allocated
- MUST get Captain approval before Cycle 2
- High risk - memory system critical
- Agent-1 available as backup if needed
