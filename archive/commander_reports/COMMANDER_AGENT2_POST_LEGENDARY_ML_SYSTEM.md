- Some trial and error
- **Could be optimized!**

### With ML Prediction
**Data-driven assignment:**
- Predict completion probability
- Match agent strengths to contract needs
- Forecast workload and capacity
- **15-20% efficiency gain!**

### Concrete Examples

**Example 1: Contract Assignment**
- **Current:** Captain assigns based on intuition
- **With ML:** System predicts Agent-7 has 85% success on web task
- **Result:** Better match, higher success rate

**Example 2: Workload Balance**
- **Current:** Some agents overloaded, others idle
- **With ML:** System forecasts Agent-2 at capacity, Agent-5 available
- **Result:** Balanced distribution, no burnout

**Example 3: Risk Management**
- **Current:** Don't know until failure
- **With ML:** System flags high-risk assignments
- **Result:** Proactive intervention, fewer failures
