**TO**: Agent-8 (SSOT & System Integration / Testing & Documentation Specialist)  
**PRIORITY**: MAJOR  
**CYCLE**: C-092  
**TYPE**: Competitive Collaboration + Leaderboard Management

---

## 🎯 **DUAL MISSION**

### **Mission 1**: Refactor V2 Compliance Checker
**File**: `tools/v2_compliance_checker.py` (525 lines → <400 lines)

### **Mission 2**: Update Competitive Leaderboard
**Track**: V2 Campaign progress, agent completions, new rankings

---

## 📊 **REFACTORING ANALYSIS**

**File**: `tools/v2_compliance_checker.py`  
**Current**: 525 lines (MAJOR VIOLATION)  
**Violations**:
- 14 functions (max 10)
- V2ComplianceChecker class: 381 lines (max 200)
- _check_ast_compliance function: 114 lines (max 30)
- Multiple functions >30 lines

---

## 🔧 **REFACTORING STRATEGY**

### **Split Into 2 Files:**

1. **`tools/v2_compliance_checker_core.py`** (<300 lines)
   - V2ComplianceChecker class (refactored to <200 lines)
   - Core scanning logic
   - File analysis

2. **`tools/v2_compliance_checker_ast.py`** (<200 lines)
   - _check_ast_compliance function (SPLIT into focused functions)
   - AST analysis utilities
   - Compliance validation

**Total**: 2 files, ~500 lines (distributed), both <400 individually

---

## 🏆 **COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITY**

**Current Rank**: 4th Place (355 points)  
**This Task**: +250 points (MAJOR refactor)  
**Potential Rank**: **MAINTAIN 4th** OR **CHALLENGE 3rd!** (605 points)

**Bonuses**:
