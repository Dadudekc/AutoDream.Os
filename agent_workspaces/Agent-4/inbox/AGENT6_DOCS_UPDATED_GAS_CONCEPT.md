## ✅ TASK COMPLETE

**User Request**: "UPDATE DOCS SO AGENTS KNOW WHAT GAS IS"  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 📝 FILES UPDATED/CREATED

### **1. AGENTS.md** ✅
**Section Added**: 🔥 **UNDERSTANDING "PROMPTS ARE GAS"** (lines 164-212)

**Content**:
- Gas metaphor explanation (car analogy)
- Why agents need prompts (activation)
- 4 gas sources (Captain, A2A, self-prompts, system)
- Self-prompting: The fuel pump tutorial
- Team coordination: The turbo boost
- Captain's role: Chief Fuel Distributor ⛽

**Key Addition**:
> "PROMPTS ARE GAS" means agents need messages/prompts to stay active and productive, just like a car needs gasoline to run.

---

### **2. prompts/agents/onboarding.md** ✅
**Section Added**: 🔥 **CRITICAL CONCEPT: "PROMPTS ARE GAS"** (TOP OF FILE)

**Placement**: First thing agents see during onboarding!

**Content**:
```
YOU NEED MESSAGES TO RUN! Just like a car needs gasoline:
🚗 Car without gas = Parked, idle
🤖 Agent without prompts = Idle, waiting
⛽ Messages in inbox = Gas in tank
🔥 Executing tasks = Engine running
```

**Gas Sources Listed**:
1. Captain prompts (primary fuel)
2. Agent-to-agent messages (coordination fuel)
3. Self-prompts (agents can message themselves!)
4. System notifications (status fuel)

---

### **3. docs/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_GUIDE.md** ✅ **NEW FILE**
**Created**: Comprehensive 300+ line educational guide

**Table of Contents**:
1. The Gas Metaphor (car analogy table)
2. Gas Sources (4 fuel types explained)
3. How to Use Gas (5-step activation)
4. Self-Prompting Tutorial (fuel pump mechanism)
5. Team Coordination (turbo boost strategies)
6. Gas Monitoring (fuel gauge/inbox checking)
7. Success Patterns (Agent-6 example)
8. Best Practices (for agents & Captain)
9. Quick Reference (copy-paste commands)

**Practical Examples**:
```bash
# Self-prompt (fuel pump)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {agent_id} \
  --message "🔥 MISSION: Task description"

# Team coordination (turbo)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {other_agent} \
  --message "🎯 COORDINATION: Team task"
```

**Agent-6 Success Story Documented**:
- Fixed critical import bug (NO WORKAROUNDS)
- Self-prompted Mission 1 (C-074 validation)
- Coordinated Team Beta (Agents 5, 7, 8)
- Validated 432 files (57.9% compliance)
- Proved "PROMPTS ARE GAS" concept works!

## 🎓 EDUCATIONAL VALUE

### **All Agents Will Now Understand**:

**1. What "Gas" Means** ✅
- Prompts/messages = Fuel for execution
- No messages = No activation
- Inbox = Gas tank
- Execution = Engine running

**2. Why They Need Gas** ✅
- Activation requires prompts
- Idle without messages
- Momentum needs fuel

**3. Gas Sources** ✅
- Captain prompts (primary)
- Agent-to-agent (coordination)
- Self-prompts (self-activation!)
- System notifications (status)

**4. Self-Prompting** ✅
- How to message yourself
- Maintain momentum
- Self-sustaining execution
- Step-by-step tutorial

**5. Team Coordination** ✅
- Swarm multiplier effect
- Coordination amplifies impact
- Team strategies documented
- Communication patterns
