---

## ‚ùå **WHAT CAPTAIN SHOULD NOT WORK ON**

### **Low-Level Implementation** 

**Why:** Agents are better suited for this work

**Examples:**
- Individual component features
- Specific UI elements
- Routine bug fixes
- Minor refactorings

**Action:** Delegate to appropriate specialist agent

---

### **Specialist Work**

**Why:** Agents have domain expertise

**Examples:**
- Frontend-specific code (‚Üí Agent-7)
- Architecture refactoring (‚Üí Agent-2)
- Infrastructure setup (‚Üí Agent-3)
- Test writing (‚Üí Agent-6)

**Action:** Assign to specialist agent

---

### **Routine Maintenance**

**Why:** Agents can handle this independently

**Examples:**
- Dependency updates
- Log cleanup
- Documentation updates
- Code formatting

**Action:** Delegate or automate

---

### **Documentation-Only Work**

**Why:** Captain should build AND document

**Examples:**
- Writing guides without building
- Creating docs for non-existent features
- Pure documentation sprints

**Action:** Combine documentation with building systems

---

## üéØ **TASK SELECTION CRITERIA**

**Good Captain Task If:**
- ‚úÖ Advances autonomy (reduces human dependency)
- ‚úÖ Benefits entire swarm (force multiplier)
- ‚úÖ Requires strategic oversight
- ‚úÖ Has high ROI (>15)
- ‚úÖ Unlocks future capabilities
- ‚úÖ Improves swarm coordination

**Bad Captain Task If:**
- ‚ùå Only benefits one agent
- ‚ùå Is routine/repetitive
- ‚ùå Requires specialist knowledge
- ‚ùå Has low strategic value
- ‚ùå Could be automated
- ‚ùå Blocks agent growth

---

## üìä **CAPTAIN TASK EXAMPLES**

### **High-Value Captain Tasks:**

1. **Autonomous Error Handler** (Autonomy: 1/3, ROI: 28)
   - Auto-classifies errors
   - Decides: retry/escalate/fail
   - Reduces human intervention

2. **Message-Task Integration** (Autonomy: 1/3, ROI: 25)
   - Automatic task creation from messages
   - Infinite autonomous loop
   - Eliminates manual task entry

3. **Coordination Error Handler** (Autonomy: 1/3, ROI: 15)
   - Resolves agent conflicts automatically
   - Prevents blocking situations
   - Enables smoother collaboration

4. **ROI Optimizer Enhancement** (Strategic value: HIGH)
   - Improves task selection accuracy
   - Better agent matching
   - Higher swarm efficiency

5. **Agent Health Monitor** (Infrastructure: HIGH)
   - Real-time status tracking
   - Automatic blocker detection
   - Proactive intervention triggers

---

### **Low-Value Captain Tasks (Delegate!):**

1. **UI Button Styling** ‚Üí Agent-7 (Frontend specialist)
2. **Test Writing** ‚Üí Agent-6 (Testing specialist)  
3. **Architecture Refactor** ‚Üí Agent-2 (Architecture specialist)
4. **Documentation Update** ‚Üí Agent-8 (SSOT specialist)
5. **Dependency Update** ‚Üí Agent-3 (Infrastructure specialist)

## ‚è∞ **TIME ALLOCATION**

**Recommended Captain Time Split:**

| Activity | % of Cycle | Time (8hr cycle) |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Coordination** | 20% | 1.5 hours |
| **Captain's Work** | 50% | 4 hours |
| **Monitoring** | 15% | 1 hour |
| **Documentation** | 10% | 45 min |
| **Planning** | 5% | 30 min |

**Captain's Work (4 hours) should be:**
- High-autonomy tasks (60%)
- Infrastructure improvements (25%)
- Strategic systems (15%)

## ‚úÖ **WORK SELECTION CHECKLIST**

Before starting a task, verify:

**Is this appropriate Captain work?**
- [ ] Advances autonomy OR
- [ ] Benefits entire swarm OR
- [ ] Requires strategic oversight OR
- [ ] Is infrastructure/leadership tool

**Is ROI justified?**
- [ ] ROI >15 OR
- [ ] High strategic value OR
- [ ] Unlocks future capabilities

**Should I delegate instead?**
- [ ] Checked if specialist agent better suited
- [ ] Confirmed not routine maintenance
- [ ] Verified requires Captain-level oversight

**All checks passed? ‚Üí Proceed with task!**

---

## üéØ **GOLDEN RULE**

> **"Captain builds systems that make agents better. Agents build features that make product better."**

**Captain = Force multiplier for swarm**  
**Agents = Direct value delivery to product**

Stay in your lane. Build what matters. Lead by example. ‚ö°
