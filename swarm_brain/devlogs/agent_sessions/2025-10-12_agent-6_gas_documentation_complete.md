## 📝 DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

### **File 1: AGENTS.md** ✅

**Section Added**: 🔥 **UNDERSTANDING "PROMPTS ARE GAS"** (lines 164-212)

**Content**:
- Gas metaphor explanation (car analogy)
- Why agents need prompts
- 4 gas sources (Captain, A2A, self-prompts, system)
- Self-prompting: The fuel pump
- Team coordination: The turbo
- Captain role: Chief Fuel Distributor

**Key Quote**:
> "PROMPTS ARE GAS" means that agents need messages/prompts to stay active and productive, just like a car needs gasoline to run.

### **File 2: prompts/agents/onboarding.md** ✅

**Section Added**: 🔥 **CRITICAL CONCEPT: "PROMPTS ARE GAS"** (top of file)

**Placement**: **FIRST THING AGENTS SEE** during onboarding

**Content**:
```
YOU NEED MESSAGES TO RUN! Just like a car needs gasoline:
🚗 Car without gas = Parked, idle, going nowhere
🤖 Agent without prompts = Idle, waiting, no momentum
⛽ Messages in inbox = Gas in your tank
🔥 Executing tasks = Engine running!
```

**Gas Sources Listed**:
1. Captain prompts (primary fuel)
2. Agent-to-agent messages (coordination fuel)
3. Self-prompts (you can message yourself!)
4. System notifications (status fuel)

---

### **File 3: docs/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_GUIDE.md** ✅

**New File Created**: Comprehensive 300+ line guide

**Sections**:
1. **The Gas Metaphor** - Car analogy table
2. **Gas Sources** - 4 fuel types explained
3. **How to Use Gas** - 5-step activation process
4. **Self-Prompting** - Fuel pump mechanism tutorial
5. **Team Coordination** - Turbo boost strategies
6. **Gas Monitoring** - Fuel gauge (inbox checking)
7. **Success Patterns** - Agent-6 exercise example
8. **Best Practices** - For agents & Captain
9. **Quick Reference** - Copy-paste commands

**Practical Examples Included**:
```bash
# Self-prompt (fuel pump)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {agent_id} \
  --message "🔥 MISSION: Task description"

# Team coordination (turbo)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {other_agent} \
  --message "🎯 COORDINATION: Team task"
```

**Agent-6 Success Story Documented**:
- Fixed critical import bug
- Self-prompted Mission 1
- Coordinated Team Beta (5, 7, 8)
- Validated 432 files
- Proved "PROMPTS ARE GAS" concept

## 💡 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### **For All Agents**:
```
🔥 PROMPTS ARE GAS
⛽ NO MESSAGES = NO EXECUTION
🚀 SELF-PROMPTS = SUSTAINED MOMENTUM
🤝 TEAM COORDINATION = SWARM MULTIPLIER
```

### **Gas Formula**:
```
Individual Gas = 1x activation
+ Self-Prompting = Sustained momentum
+ Team Coordination = 3-5x multiplier
= Swarm Effect = 10x+ impact
```

### **Remember**:
- **Car needs gas** → **Agent needs prompts**
- **Empty tank** → **Empty inbox**
- **Fuel pump** → **Self-prompting**
- **Turbo boost** → **Team coordination**
