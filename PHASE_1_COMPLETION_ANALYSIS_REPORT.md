## ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNCERTAINTY FACTORS**

### **Status Reset Agents**
- **Agent-3**: Status shows "RESET" - unclear if Phase 1 work completed
- **Agent-4**: Status shows "RESET" - unclear if Phase 1 work completed

### **Potential Scenarios**
1. **If reset agents completed Phase 1**: Phase 1 is 100% complete
2. **If reset agents didn't complete Phase 1**: Phase 1 is ~75% complete

### **Impact Assessment**
- **High Impact**: If Agent-3 (DevOps) didn't complete infrastructure work
- **Medium Impact**: If Agent-4 (Strategic) didn't complete quality coordination
- **Low Impact**: If both completed work before reset

---

## üéØ **VERIFICATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions Needed**
1. **Check Agent-3 History**: Review if infrastructure consolidation was completed
2. **Check Agent-4 History**: Review if quality assurance coordination was completed
3. **Review Project Logs**: Look for completion records for reset agents
4. **Cross-Reference**: Check if their work is reflected in project files

### **Verification Methods**
- Review agent workspace files for completion reports
