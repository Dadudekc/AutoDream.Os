Continued autonomous work cycle by eliminating unnecessary wrapper files. Deleted 6+ small wrapper files that were importing from non-existent refactored files: 1) analysis_tools.py (17 lines), 2) error_reporting.py (18 lines), 3) performance_benchmark_suite.py (17 lines), 4) factory.py (17 lines), 5) engine_core.py (13 lines), 6) message_validation_engine.py (10 lines), 7) emergency_intervention_engine.py (11 lines), 8) file_locking_engine.py (12 lines). Total cleanup: 115+ lines of dead code eliminated. Codebase further simplified by removing broken import references.
