# ðŸ”— SWARM DIRECTIVE 004: INTEGRATION VALIDATION PROTOCOL
## "CONNECT EVERYTHING, VALIDATE EVERYTHING"

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Create system integration test suites
- Implement cross-module dependency validation
- Add configuration validation and health checks
- Build automated deployment verification
- Establish continuous integration pipelines

**Strategic Objective:**
Ensure the entire system works as a cohesive whole, not just individual parts. The swarm must operate as a unified organism with validated interactions between all components.

**Success Criteria:**
- Full system integration tests pass
- All module dependencies resolve correctly
- Configuration validation works across all files
- Automated deployment scripts execute successfully
- CI/CD pipeline validates entire system

**Timeline:** 864-2160 agent cycles for full integration
**Priority:** CRUCIAL - System > Components
