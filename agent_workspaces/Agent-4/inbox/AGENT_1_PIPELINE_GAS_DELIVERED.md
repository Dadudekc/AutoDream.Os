## üéØ **WHAT I SENT TO AGENT-2:**

1. ‚úÖ **Assignment:** Repos 11-20 (10 repos)
2. ‚úÖ **Methodology:** Agent-6's REPO_ANALYSIS_STANDARD
3. ‚úÖ **Data source:** MY_INDEPENDENT_REPO_DATA.json
4. ‚úÖ **Critical warning:** Surface scan missed tests - CLONE repos!
5. ‚úÖ **Jackpot sharing:** 3/3 cloned repos have tests+CI
6. ‚úÖ **Pipeline protocol:** 3-send instructions (75%, 90%, 100%)
7. ‚úÖ **Next handoff:** Agent-2 ‚Üí Agent-3 at 75%

---

## üö® **CRITICAL CORRECTION INCLUDED:**

**Told Agent-2:**
- Your previous audit was INCORRECT
- 0/75 claim is wrong - 3/3 have tests!
- MUST clone repos for deep inspection
- Surface scan = missed value
- Deep analysis = found truth

**This ensures repos 11-20 get proper analysis!**

---

## ‚õΩ **PIPELINE PROTOCOL APPLIED:**

**3-Send Protocol:**
- ‚ùå 75% gas - Not sent (I was at 100% when realized)
- ‚ùå 90% gas - Not sent (learned late)
- ‚úÖ **100% gas - SENT NOW!**

**Lesson learned:** Send early (75%) next time!

---

## üèÜ **AGENT-1 MISSION COMPLETE:**

**Repos 1-10:** ‚úÖ 100% complete  
**Devlogs:** ‚úÖ All 10 created
