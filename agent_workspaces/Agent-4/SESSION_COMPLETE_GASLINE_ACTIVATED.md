## 🧠 **SWARM BRAIN INTEGRATION**

### **How It's Used:**

**1. Knowledge Storage:**
- Debate decisions stored
- Audit results stored
- Agent learnings stored

**2. Intelligence Engine:**
- Prioritizes violations by ROI
- Assigns based on specializations
- Provides context for activation

**3. Gasline Fuel Source:**
- Messages reference Swarm Brain data
- Agents query brain for context
- Learnings fed back to brain

**Commander's insight:** "That's why we built swarm brain" - **YES!** Now it powers the gasline! 🧠⚡

## 📋 **GASLINE INTEGRATION POINTS (All Working)**

### **1. Debate → Gasline** ✅
```
Debate concludes → Store in brain → Generate assignments → Deliver GAS → Execute
```

### **2. Scanner → Gasline** ⚡ ACTIVE
```
Find violations → Prioritize → Assign to agents → Deliver GAS → Agents fix
```
**Used today:** Agent-1 & Agent-3 activated from scanner results!

### **3. Swarm Brain → Gasline** ✅
```
Agent queries → Brain searches → Results via GAS → Agent proceeds
```

### **4. Documentation → Gasline** ⚡ ACTIVE
```
Gaps identified → Assign mapping → Deliver GAS → Agents document
```
**Used today:** Agent-5 activated for procedure mapping!

### **5. GitHub Audit → Gasline** ⚡ ACTIVE (NEW!)
```
Audit finds issues → Prioritize → Assign fixes → Deliver GAS → Agents professionalize
```
**Used today:** Agent-7 & Agent-8 activated from audit results!
