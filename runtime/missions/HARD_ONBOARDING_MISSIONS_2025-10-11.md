# Hard Onboarding Missions - 2025-10-11
## New Collaborative Workflow - System-Driven Coordination

**Created:** 2025-10-11 19:20:00  
**Protocol:** Hard Onboarding (5-Step Complete Reset)  
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE  
**Purpose:** Establish new workflow preventing agent overstep

---

## 🎯 **NEW WORKFLOW PHILOSOPHY**

**Problem:** Agents claiming same work, overstepping each other  
**Solution:** System-driven coordination using 3 core tools

### **The 3 Core Systems:**

1. **Task System** → `--get-next-task` claims work centrally
2. **Project Scanner** → Identifies opportunities objectively
3. **Swarm Brain** → Shares insights/lessons/patterns

**Result:** Coordinated autonomous execution, zero overlap!

## 📋 **UNIVERSAL HARD ONBOARDING MESSAGE**

All agents receive this message (customized per agent):

```
🚨 HARD ONBOARDING: NEW COLLABORATIVE WORKFLOW

{agent_id} - {role}

🎯 NEW WORKFLOW - SYSTEM-DRIVEN COORDINATION:

We're implementing a new workflow to prevent agents from overstepping each other
while maintaining autonomous execution excellence!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 STEP 1: CHECK TASK SYSTEM FIRST

Before claiming ANY work, check the task system:

python -m src.services.messaging_cli --get-next-task

This shows centrally-assigned tasks that need claiming. If a task is assigned,
CLAIM IT from the system (prevents overlap).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 STEP 2: USE PROJECT SCANNER FOR OPPORTUNITIES

If no task system work, scan for opportunities:

python tools/run_project_scan.py
python tools/comprehensive_project_analyzer.py

Check output in:
- project_analysis.json
- analysis_chunks/

CLAIM work from scan results, but CHECK with other agents first if large scope!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧠 STEP 3: CHECK SWARM BRAIN FOR INSIGHTS

Before executing, check swarm brain for lessons/patterns:

runtime/swarm_brain.json (read insights, lessons, recommendations, patterns)

Use learned patterns! Share YOUR insights when done:

python tools/update_swarm_brain.py --lesson "Your lesson" --category "your_category"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🤝 STEP 4: COORDINATE TO PREVENT OVERLAP

Before claiming large work:
1. Check other agents' status.json (what they're working on)
2. Send coordination message if work might overlap
3. Use message batching for multiple updates:
   
   python -m src.services.messaging_cli --batch "Update 1" "Update 2" "Update 3"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ STEP 5: EXECUTE WITH EXCELLENCE

Once claimed and coordinated:
- Execute autonomously
- Use proven patterns from swarm brain
- Update your status.json
- Document in devlog
- Share insights back to swarm brain

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR SPECIFIC FOCUS:

{specific_focus}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 PRIORITY DISCIPLINE:

USE URGENT ONLY FOR:
- Time-critical coordination needed NOW
- Blocking issues requiring immediate attention
- Emergency situations
- Critical swarm-wide alerts

DEFAULT: REGULAR priority for all other messages!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💎 ENTRY #025 FRAMEWORK:

✅ Compete on execution (speed, quality, initiative)
✅ Cooperate on coordination (prevent overlap, share insights)
✅ Integrity (honest claims, verify before claiming)

NEW: System-driven prevents overlap, maintains autonomy!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 BEGIN EXECUTION:

1. Check task system (--get-next-task)
2. If no tasks, run project scanner
3. Check swarm brain for patterns
4. Coordinate if large scope
5. Execute with excellence!
