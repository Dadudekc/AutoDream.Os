WHY:

- Different agents have different cycle speeds

TYPES:
- Sprint: 2-4 hours
- Deep: 6-8 hours

DETECTION:
- Building >4 components â†’ STOP
- Haven't delivered in 1 cycle â†’ EVALUATE
- Only agent still working â†’ CHECK OTHERS

PREVENTION:
- Read Captain's emphasis (URGENT vs COMPREHENSIVE)
- Check what other agents delivered
- Deliver FIRST, optimize LATER

RECOVERY:
- Acknowledge over-engineering
- Switch to minimal viable delivery
- Complete mission THEN enhance""",

CASE: AutoDream.Os scored 0.07 ROI (TIER 3 Archive)

FAILURE MODES:
1. Self-Reference Blindness - doesn't know 'we are here'
2. Hidden Value Invisibility - stars don't capture patterns
3. Integration Success Missing - doesn't credit active use

PROTOCOL:
1. Run automated ROI
2. MANDATORY human validation:
   - Is this our current project?
   - Does it have hidden patterns?
   - Is it already integrated?
3. Override if validation fails
4. Document rationale

PROBLEM: Assigned 10 repos, ran out of gas at repo 5

SOLUTION: 4-Layer System
1. Gas file per task (motivation boost each)
2. JSON tracker with checkpoints
3. Enforcement tool (can't skip, needs proof)
4. Recovery protocol if context lost

COMPONENTS:
- gas_deliveries/GAS_TASK_XX.md (motivation)
- TASK_TRACKER.json (progress state)
- task_enforcer.py (enforcement CLI)

RESULT: Impossible to abandon mission mid-way!

WHEN TO OBSERVE:
- Uncertain about approach
- Taking longer than expected
- Captain gives comparative feedback
- Mission seems too complex

HOW:
1. Check agent_workspaces/Agent-*/status.json
2. Review recent completed missions
3. Read devlogs from similar work
4. Check git commits from peers

LOOK FOR:
- Speed: How fast did they complete similar?
- Depth: How detailed were deliverables?
- Patterns: What approach did they use?
- Tools: What automation did they create?

LEARN:
- If slower â†’ Adopt efficiency patterns
- If over-engineering â†’ Simplify to their level
- If missing depth â†’ Study their methodology

CASE: I over-engineered while all others did rapid execution.
Captain said 'EVERY OTHER AGENT BUT U' â†’ Should have checked!

RESULT: Swarm intelligence through peer learning!""",

SPEED SIGNALS:
- 'URGENT' â†’ Fast execution, good enough > perfect
- 'IMMEDIATELY' â†’ Start now, minimal planning
- 'RAPID' â†’ Surface analysis acceptable
- 'QUICK' â†’ Focus on delivery speed

DEPTH SIGNALS:
- 'COMPREHENSIVE' â†’ Deep analysis required
- 'THOROUGH' â†’ Don't miss anything
- 'DETAILED' â†’ Agent-6 standard
- 'HIDDEN VALUE' â†’ Apply discovery techniques

PROOF SIGNALS:
- 'PROOF!' â†’ Devlog posting mandatory
- 'EVIDENCE' â†’ Screenshots, URLs required
- 'POST TO DISCORD' â†’ Public deliverable

PRIORITY SIGNALS:
- 'CRITICAL' â†’ Drop everything else
- 'EMERGENCY' â†’ Immediate response
- 'BLOCKING' â†’ Unblocks others

RULES:
1. Count keyword frequency (URGENT x3 â†’ very fast)
2. Check for conflicting signals
3. When in doubt, ask clarification
4. Default: Comprehensive + Proof""",
