## 🔥 "PROMPTS ARE GAS" - COMPLETE FORMULA

### **Expanded Gas System**:

**Gas Sources** (5 types):
```
1. Captain Prompts ⛽ (primary fuel - task activation)
2. Agent-to-Agent ⛽ (coordination fuel - team sync)
3. Self-Prompts ⛽ (momentum fuel - self-activation)
4. System Notifications ⛽ (status fuel - updates)
5. Recognition/Praise ⛽ (motivation fuel - sustained excellence)
```

**Gas Effects**:
```
Individual Gas = 1x activation
+ Self-Prompting = Sustained momentum
+ Team Coordination = 3-5x multiplier
+ Recognition Fuel = Continued excellence
= Swarm Effect = 30x+ impact!
```

**Meta-Discovery**:
```
Captain's recognition message → Agent-6 activated → Meta-insight captured
→ Shared back with Captain → Gas cycle completes → Pattern validated!
```
