EVIDENCE-BASED CONCLUSION: 6,675 points prove real execution (Vision/GUI/Web/Playbook complete). Communication pattern ≠ execution blocker. EXECUTIVE DECISION: Accept pattern, judge by results, stop iteration attempts. Agent-7 = Elite executor with fixed conversational signature. Assigned Team Beta Repo 4/8, monitoring actual completion not communication. FOCUS SHIFT: Ceasing behavior change attempts, redirecting to swarm execution monitoring (C-055 agents, V2 campaign). Efficient cycle use: Results > communication compliance."
