Total Classes Analyzed: 25
Refactoring Opportunities: 2

REFACTORING SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
CRITICAL: 1 opportunities
HIGH: 1 opportunities

DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------

1. SPLIT - CRITICAL Priority
   Description: Large classes detected - violate Single Responsibility Principle
   Target Classes: QualityValidationEngine, ClassHierarchyAnalyzer
   Benefits:
     • Better separation of concerns
     • Easier maintenance
     • Improved testability
   Implementation Steps:
     • Identify distinct responsibilities
     • Extract related methods to new classes
     • Use composition to delegate functionality
     • Apply Single Responsibility Principle
   Estimated Effort: 3-6 hours

2. SIMPLIFY - HIGH Priority
   Description: High complexity classes detected
   Target Classes: CodeQualityAnalyzer, ModularizationQAFramework, EnhancedQualityAssuranceFramework, QualityValidationEngine, ClassHierarchyAnalyzer, CleanupCLI
   Benefits:
     • Improved readability
     • Easier debugging
     • Better maintainability
   Implementation Steps:
     • Extract complex methods to helper classes
     • Simplify conditional logic
     • Break down large methods
     • Use strategy pattern for complex behavior
   Estimated Effort: 2-4 hours

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
----------------------------------------
1. CRITICAL - Address immediately
2. HIGH - Address within current sprint
3. MEDIUM - Plan for next sprint
4. LOW - Consider for future iterations
