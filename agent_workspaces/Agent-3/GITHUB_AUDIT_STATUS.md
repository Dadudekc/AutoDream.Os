# 🔍 AGENT-3 GITHUB INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT - IN PROGRESS

**Agent**: Agent-3 (Infrastructure & DevOps Specialist)  
**Mission**: Independent Repository Audit (Unbiased Verification)  
**Priority**: 🚨 URGENT  
**Status**: 🔄 SCANNING IN PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 MISSION OVERVIEW

**Commander's Directive**: Independent verification of Agent-6's findings  
**Agent-6 Claims**: 45/75 repos should archive (60%)  
**My Task**: Provide INFRASTRUCTURE-based assessment (unbiased!)

## 📊 MY INDEPENDENT CRITERIA

### Infrastructure Quality Scoring (0-100)

**Automation & CI/CD** (30 pts):
- GitHub Actions/CI (15 pts)
- Automated tests (10 pts)
- Deployment automation (5 pts)

**Containerization** (25 pts):
- Docker/containers (15 pts)
- Orchestration (K8s/Compose) (10 pts)

**Monitoring & Observability** (20 pts):
- Logging/monitoring (10 pts)
- Health checks (10 pts)

**Code Quality Infrastructure** (15 pts):
- Test suite (10 pts)
- Linting/formatting (5 pts)

**Dependency Management** (10 pts):
- Dependencies declared (5 pts)
- Up-to-date (<1 year) (5 pts)

### Classification Rules

- **KEEP** (≥60 pts): Good infrastructure
- **NEEDS WORK** (30-59 pts): Fixable
- **ARCHIVE** (<30 pts): Poor infrastructure + high burden + old

**Active development trumps poor infrastructure!**

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS

**Phase 1**: ✅ Framework established  
**Phase 2**: 🔄 Scanning 75 repos (in progress)  
**Phase 3**: ⏳ Classification pending  
**Phase 4**: ⏳ Comparison with Agent-6 pending  
**Phase 5**: ⏳ Final report pending

---

## 🚫 UNBIASED APPROACH

**CRITICAL**: No reading of Agent-6's data until MY analysis complete!

**Why**:
- Independent perspective required
- Infrastructure lens vs ROI lens
- Third verification for Commander

**My Focus**: DevOps, automation, maintainability

---

## ⏰ NEXT STEPS

1. ⏳ Complete repo scanning (75 repos)
2. ⏳ Generate MY classification
3. ⏳ THEN read Agent-6's analysis
4. ⏳ Compare & identify discrepancies
5. ⏳ Provide unbiased recommendation

---

**Status**: Scanner running in background...  
**ETA**: ~5-10 minutes for 75 repos

**🐝 WE ARE SWARM - Independent verification in progress!** ⚡
