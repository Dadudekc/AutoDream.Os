# 🐝 Swarm-Ready Agent Contracts for 400-599 LOC Files

## 📊 **Contract System Overview**

The Agent Cellphone V2 project now has a comprehensive contract system ready for swarm distribution to handle the **75 files between 400-599 lines of code**.

## 🎯 **Target: 400 LOC Compliance**

- **Standard files:** Target ≤400 LOC
- **GUI files:** Target ≤600 LOC  
- **Focus:** Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) compliance
- **Architecture:** Modular, production-ready code

## 📋 **Available Contract Phases**

### **Phase 3-8: Moderate Violations (400+ LOC)**
Each phase contains **10 contracts** for systematic modularization:

| Phase | Contract File | Status | Files | Contracts |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Phase 3** | `phase3_moderate_400plus_loc.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-001 to 010 |
| **Phase 4** | `phase4_moderate_400plus_batch2.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-011 to 020 |
| **Phase 5** | `phase5_moderate_400plus_batch3.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-021 to 030 |
| **Phase 6** | `phase6_moderate_400plus_batch4.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-031 to 040 |
| **Phase 7** | `phase7_moderate_400plus_batch5.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-041 to 050 |
| **Phase 8** | `phase8_moderate_400plus_batch6.json` | ✅ **READY** | 10 | MODERATE-051 to 060 |

**Total Available Contracts: 60 contracts covering 60 files**

## 🚀 **How Swarm Agents Can Get Started**

### **1. Choose a Contract**
- Each contract has a unique `contract_id` (e.g., `MODERATE-001`)
- All contracts are marked as `"status": "AVAILABLE"`
- `"assigned_to": "UNASSIGNED"` means they're ready for pickup

### **2. Contract Structure**
Each contract includes:
- **File path** to refactor
- **Current vs. target** LOC counts
- **Refactoring goals** with specific concerns to separate
- **Step-by-step workflow** (10 steps)
- **Expected deliverables** (3-4 new modules + orchestrator)
- **Quality gates** for completion

### **3. Workflow Pattern**
Standard 10-step process:
1. Analyze file structure and responsibilities
2. Create core module (≤200 LOC)
3. Create secondary module (≤150 LOC)  
4. Create tertiary module (≤150 LOC)
5. Refactor main file to orchestrate (≤150 LOC)
6. Update imports and dependencies
7. Test functionality
8. Delete original monolithic file
9. Update V2 compliance progress tracker

## 📁 **File Categories Ready for Modularization**

### **AI/ML Components**
- Agent factories, trainers, analyzers
- Workflow engines, orchestrators
- Model managers, optimizers
- Memory, learning, planning systems

### **Core Infrastructure**
- Health monitoring, security management
- Database, network, cache managers
- Logging, configuration, validation
- Events, queues, synchronization

### **Web & Frontend**
- Frontend applications, routing
- UI interactions, testing frameworks
- Health monitoring web components

## 🎯 **Swarm Distribution Strategy**

### **Batch Processing**
- **Phase 3-8:** 60 contracts ready immediately
- **Remaining phases:** 9-16 can be created as needed
- **Estimated effort:** 1-2 days per contract

### **Parallel Execution**
- Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- No conflicts between different contracts
- Each contract targets a unique file

### **Quality Assurance**
- Built-in quality gates for each contract
- Comprehensive testing requirements
- LOC compliance verification
- Functionality preservation checks

## 📈 **Progress Tracking**

### **V2 Compliance Impact**
- Each completed contract moves a file from 400+ LOC to ≤400 LOC
- Progress automatically tracked in compliance system
- Cumulative impact on overall project standards

### **Metrics Available**
- Total contracts completed
- Files successfully modularized
- LOC reduction achieved
- SRP compliance percentage

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **For Swarm Agents**
- Python development environment
- Understanding of Single Responsibility Principle
- Ability to create modular, testable code
- Git workflow knowledge

### **Deliverables Per Contract**
- 3-4 focused modules (≤200 LOC each)
- 1 orchestrator file (≤150 LOC)
- Updated imports and dependencies
- Comprehensive testing
- Updated compliance tracker

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Review available contracts** in the contract files
2. **Select a contract** by ID (e.g., `MODERATE-001`)
3. **Follow the 10-step workflow** precisely
4. **Meet all quality gates** before marking complete
5. **Update compliance tracker** with progress

## 📞 **Support & Coordination**

- **Contract System:** Self-contained with all necessary information
- **Workflow:** Standardized across all contracts
- **Quality Gates:** Built-in validation criteria
- **Progress Tracking:** Automated through compliance system

**🎯 Ready for Swarm Deployment: 60 contracts covering 60 files in the 400-599 LOC range!**

The swarm can now systematically tackle the remaining moderate violations and bring the entire codebase into V2 compliance standards.
