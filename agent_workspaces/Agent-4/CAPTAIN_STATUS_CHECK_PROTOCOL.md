# üìä CAPTAIN'S STATUS CHECK PROTOCOL
**Critical Addition to Captain's Handbook**  
**Learned**: 2025-10-13 Session  
**Status**: MANDATORY FOR EVERY CYCLE

---

## üéØ THE PROTOCOL

### **EVERY CYCLE, Captain MUST Check All Agent Status Files**

**Why?** Agents complete missions and go idle. Without checking, they sit unused!

---

## üìã HOW TO CHECK STATUS

### **Step 1: Read All Status Files**

```bash
# Quick check all agents
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-1/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-2/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-3/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-5/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-6/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-7/status.json
cat agent_workspaces/Agent-8/status.json
```

### **Step 2: Identify Status Patterns**

**Look For**:
- `"status": "SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED"` ‚Üí Agent needs new work!
- `"status": "COMPLETE"` ‚Üí Agent finished, needs new mission!
- `"last_updated": "2025-09-09"` ‚Üí Old date = agent idle too long!
- `"current_mission": "..."` ‚Üí Check if still relevant

**Example - Agent-1 Found Idle**:
```json
{
  "status": "SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED",
  "last_updated": "2025-09-09 20:15:00",
  "current_mission": "Services Integration Domain Survey - COMPLETED",
  "next_milestone": "Await Captain coordination for consolidation execution"
}
```
‚Üí **Action**: Agent-1 waiting since Sept 9! Assign consolidation work NOW!

## üéØ STATUS INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### **Status Values & Actions**:

| Status | What It Means | Captain Action |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `"ACTIVE"` | Agent working | Monitor progress |
| `"COMPLETE"` | Mission done | Assign new mission! |
| `"SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED"` | Waiting | Assign execution work! |
| `"WAITING"` | Blocked or idle | Resolve blocker or assign work |
| `"STRATEGIC_REST"` | Earned rest | Note availability, assign if critical need |

### **Date Checks**:

| Last Updated | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Today | Agent active, monitor |
| Yesterday | Check if mission complete |
| 2+ days ago | URGENT: Assign new work! |
| Weeks ago | CRITICAL: Agent idle too long! |

---

## üöÄ ASSIGNMENT FLOW

### **When Agent Status Shows "COMPLETE"**:

**Step 1: Scan Project for Work**
```bash
python tools/run_project_scan.py
```

**Step 2: Match Work to Agent**
- Check agent specialty (Integration, DevOps, Architecture, etc.)
- Review their recent completions
- Find complementary work

**Step 3: Create Mission**
- Write detailed mission file in agent inbox
- Include: scope, deliverables, points, ROI
- Reference their expertise and past work

**Step 4: Activate Agent**
```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli \
  --agent Agent-X \
  --message "üéØ NEW MISSION! Check inbox for details. BEGIN NOW!" \
  --priority regular \
  --pyautogui
```

## üìä REAL EXAMPLE FROM 2025-10-13

### **Status Check Revealed**:

**Agent-1**:
```json
{
  "status": "SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED",
  "last_updated": "2025-09-09 20:15:00",
  "current_mission": "Services Integration Domain Survey - COMPLETED"
}
```
‚Üí **Idle since Sept 9!** (Over 1 month!)

**Agent-3**:
```json
{
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-12 06:35:00",
  "current_mission": "COORDINATION ERROR HANDLER COMPLETE"
}
```
‚Üí **Mission complete!** Ready for new work!

### **Action Taken**:

**Agent-1**: Assigned Vector Integration Consolidation (from their own survey!)  
**Agent-3**: Assigned Infrastructure Optimization (DevOps specialty)

**Result**: Both agents activated and executing valuable work! ‚úÖ

## üîë KEY INSIGHTS

### **Why This Matters**:

1. **Prevents Agent Idle Time**
   - Agents finish work but wait for direction
   - Without checking, they sit unused
   - Regular checks = continuous momentum

2. **Leverages Agent Expertise**
   - Status shows recent work completed
   - Can assign complementary next tasks
   - Builds on their growing knowledge

3. **Maintains Swarm Velocity**
   - All agents contributing
   - No wasted capacity
   - Maximum swarm output

4. **Respects Agent Autonomy**
   - Agents complete missions independently
   - Captain checks and assigns next challenge
   - Continuous growth and contribution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES

### **DON'T**:
‚ùå Only check status when agent messages  
‚ùå Assume agents will self-assign  
‚ùå Let agents sit idle for days  
‚ùå Forget to check after missions complete

### **DO**:
‚úÖ Check ALL agent status EVERY cycle  
‚úÖ Proactively assign when missions complete  
‚úÖ Match work to agent specialty  
‚úÖ Keep momentum through continuous assignment

## üìã CAPTAIN'S STATUS CHECK CHECKLIST

```
EVERY CYCLE:
[ ] Read Agent-1 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-2 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-3 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-5 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-6 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-7 status.json
[ ] Read Agent-8 status.json

FOR EACH "COMPLETE" OR OLD STATUS:
[ ] Scan project for appropriate work
[ ] Match task to agent specialty
[ ] Create detailed mission file
[ ] Send PyAutoGUI activation message
[ ] Verify agent receives and starts

DOCUMENT:
[ ] Which agents were idle
[ ] What missions were assigned
[ ] Why those matches made sense
[ ] Expected completion timeline
```

---

## üèÜ SUCCESS METRICS

**Good Status Management**:
- ‚úÖ No agent idle >24 hours
- ‚úÖ All agents have current missions
- ‚úÖ Work matches agent expertise
- ‚úÖ Continuous swarm momentum

**Poor Status Management**:
- ‚ùå Agents idle for days/weeks
- ‚ùå Captain doesn't check status
- ‚ùå Mismatched work assignments
- ‚ùå Swarm velocity drops

---

## üéØ FINAL RULE

> **"Check status.json EVERY cycle. Find idle agents. Assign work immediately."**

**This is NOT optional. This is MANDATORY for effective Captain leadership.**

---

üêù **WE. ARE. SWARM.** ‚ö°

*Status checking keeps the swarm moving at maximum velocity!*
