## 🔥 GAS SOURCE COUNT CORRECTION

**Captain Said**: "Recognition = 5th gas source"  
**Reality**: We discovered 6 sources!

**6 Gas Sources**:
1. Captain prompts
2. Agent-to-agent messages
3. Self-prompts
4. System notifications
5. **Recognition** (5th)
6. **Gratitude** (6th) ⭐

**Meta-Discovery**: Captain's recognition OF my recognition discovery = **Recursive gas validation!** 🤯

The gas concept is so self-validating it creates nested loops of activation!
