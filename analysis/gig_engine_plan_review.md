# AutoDream.GigEngine v1 Plan Review

## Overview
The proposed AutoDream.GigEngine v1 establishes an end-to-end pipeline for sourcing, qualifying, quoting, and executing small software gigs between $30 and $150. The workflow spans lead harvesting across community platforms, structured qualification, rapid quoting with standardized SKUs, payment handling, execution via reusable blueprints, and final QA with upsell prompts. Core automation assets include templated communications, pricing catalogs, minimal forms, CLI helpers, and blueprint starter kits.

## Strengths
- **Clear role delineation:** Six sequential roles (LeadHarvester → Qualifier → Quoter → Closer → Executor → Reviewer) minimize ambiguity and support hand-offs.
- **Repeatable pricing:** `offers.json` acts as the single source of truth (SSOT) for SKUs, pricing, scope, and turnaround time, helping maintain consistent quotes and invoices.
- **Templated communication:** Prewritten DM, quote, delivery, and upsell templates standardize messaging and reduce cognitive load.
- **Executable blueprints:** Ready-made project scaffolds for Python bug fixes, Excel automation, and Discord bots accelerate delivery.
- **Automation scripts:** CLI utilities (gig creation, quoting, invoicing, packaging, webhook server) reduce manual toil and enforce process consistency.

## Risks & Gaps
- **Lead acquisition intensity:** Achieving sub-10-minute response times requires continuous monitoring or automation; manual workflows may miss SLAs.
- **Qualification depth:** `forms/brief_min.json` captures essentials but may miss edge cases (e.g., environment details, API auth). Insufficient scoping risks scope creep.
- **Payment dependency:** Reliance on Stripe payment links assumes clients accept off-platform transactions, which may conflict with Reddit/Fiverr/Upwork policies.
- **Blueprint coverage:** Current blueprints cover three archetypes; requests outside these patterns could stall Executors unless additional playbooks exist.
- **Validation rigor:** `validation.sh` scripts are blueprint-specific and lightweight; lacking generalized testing guidelines may yield inconsistent QA results.
- **Resource coordination:** The plan presumes team availability across all roles; in a small team or solo context, role multiplexing needs clear guidance to avoid bottlenecks.

## Recommendations
1. **Automate lead capture:** Deploy lightweight scrapers or API integrations aligned with `search_terms.yaml` to populate `runtime/gigs/inbox/` automatically, reducing manual monitoring.
2. **Enhance qualification schema:** Extend `brief_min.json` to include environment constraints, access credentials policy, and success metrics while keeping the SSOT principle intact.
3. **Platform compliance:** Document per-platform outreach/payment policies to mitigate account risks, and add fallback payment options (e.g., Upwork contracts) when required.
4. **Blueprint expansion roadmap:** Prioritize additional blueprints for web fixes, API integrations, and data scraping to cover every SKU in `offers.json`.
5. **QA standardization:** Introduce a universal `qa_checklist.md` reference inside blueprints and require `results.md` to summarize validation commands and outcomes.
6. **Role automation playbooks:** Provide guidance for single-operator execution (e.g., timeboxing each role) and escalation protocols for blockers beyond 1 hour.

## Metrics Alignment
- **Revenue target:** The SKU ladder maintains the ≥$30 revenue floor; adding higher-tier bundles can increase average gig value.
- **Close rate:** Implementing a CRM-like dashboard for lead scoring (via `lead_score.json`) and follow-up reminders will help achieve the 40% close goal.
- **Revision control:** Enforcing the SSOT on deliverables and assumptions in each quote plus stronger qualification questions should reduce revisions.

## Next Steps
- Configure environment variables (`STRIPE_LINK_BASE`, Discord webhooks) and document deployment for `webhook_server.py`.
- Create onboarding docs clarifying SSOT ownership for offers, templates, and blueprints to prevent divergence.
- Set up analytics to log timestamps for each SLA milestone (lead response, payment-to-delivery) inside `runtime/gigs/{gig_id}/` metadata.
- Pilot the workflow with a small cohort to validate throughput and refine scripts based on real gig feedback.
