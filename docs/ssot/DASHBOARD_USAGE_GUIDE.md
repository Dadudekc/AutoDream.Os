## 📖 HOW TO READ THE DASHBOARDS

### V2 Compliance Dashboard:

**Overall Compliance Metric**:
```
V2 Compliance Status: 98.8% compliant (889 files, 11 violations)
████████████████████████████████████████████████░░ 98.8%
```

**Interpretation**:
- **98.8%**: Percentage of files under 400 lines
- **889 files**: Total files in project
- **11 violations**: Files exceeding 400 lines (excluding exceptions)
- **Progress bar**: Visual representation of compliance

**What This Means**:
- ✅ Green (>95%): Excellent compliance
- ⚠️ Yellow (90-95%): Good, room for improvement
- ❌ Red (<90%): Needs urgent attention

---

### Agent Progress Visualization:

**Example** (Agent-5):
```
Before:  ████████████████████ 2,238 lines (4 violations)
After:   ████████ 1,100 lines (0 violations)
Reduction: -51%
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Bar length**: Represents total lines of code
- **Numbers**: Line counts before/after refactoring
- **Reduction %**: Efficiency of refactoring

**What This Means**:
- Longer bar = more code
- Shorter bar after = successful reduction
- Higher reduction % = better refactoring

---

### Consolidation Progress Table:

**Example Row**:
```
| System | Agent | Target Reduction | Current Status | Completion % |
|--------|-------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Messaging | Agent-2 | 13→3 files | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Target Reduction**: Planned file consolidation (13 files → 3 files)
- **Current Status**: 
  - ✅ COMPLETE: Finished
  - 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Active work
  - 📋 PLANNED: Not started yet
- **Completion %**: How much of the task is done

---
