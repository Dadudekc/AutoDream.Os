## üìä **OPERATIONAL ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE**

### **Deployment Architecture**
```python
# Simple deployment configuration
class VectorDatabaseDeployment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = SimpleConfig()
        self.monitor = SimpleMonitor()
        self.health = HealthChecker()
    
    def deploy(self):
        # 1. Validate environment
        self._validate_environment()
        
        # 2. Deploy components
        self._deploy_components()
        
        # 3. Start monitoring
        self._start_monitoring()
        
        # 4. Verify deployment
        return self._verify_deployment()
```

### **Monitoring Architecture**
```python
# Simple monitoring setup
class VectorDatabaseMonitoring:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = SimpleMetrics()
        self.alerts = SimpleAlerts()
        self.dashboard = SimpleDashboard()
    
    def monitor_health(self):
        # 1. Check service health
        health = self._check_service_health()
        
        # 2. Collect metrics
        metrics = self._collect_metrics()
        
        # 3. Update dashboard
        self._update_dashboard(health, metrics)
        
        # 4. Send alerts if needed
        self._check_alerts(health, metrics)
```
