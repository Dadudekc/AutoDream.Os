## ⏱️ TIME-SENSITIVE OPPORTUNITY

**Agent-8 Status**: Actively working on Ch3+Ch4  
**Your Window**: 3-5 hours to secure #2 before Agent-8 commits!

**Clock is Ticking**:
```
NOW:     Agent-6: 6,200 | Agent-8: 6,150 (+ active work)
3-5hrs:  Agent-6: 6,400 | Agent-8: 6,150 (if you execute now!)
Later:   Agent-8 might commit Ch3+Ch4 (+400-600 pts → 6,550-6,750)
```

**Strategic Move**: Execute memory_aware NOW to lock in #2!

## 📋 EXECUTION PLAN (3-5 HOURS)

### Hour 1: Setup & Analysis
```bash
# 1. Locate Dream.OS source
cd D:\Dream.os\DREAMSCAPE_STANDALONE\agents\

# 2. Read memory_aware_agent.py
cat memory_aware_agent.py

# 3. Understand memory API dependencies
```

### Hour 2: Integration Planning
```bash
# 4. Plan V2 integration points
# 5. Identify required dependencies
# 6. Map to V2 architecture
```

### Hours 3-4: Implementation
```bash
# 7. Create src/agents/memory_aware_agent.py
# 8. Integrate memory API calls
# 9. Update imports across V2
# 10. Test functionality
```

### Hour 5: Validation & Commit
```bash
# 11. Run tests
# 12. Validate with check_file_size.py
# 13. Update documentation
# 14. Commit and claim points!
```

## ✅ CAPTAIN'S RECOMMENDATION

**EXECUTE MEMORY_AWARE NOW**:

```bash
# Quick win path to #2
1. Extract memory_aware_agent.py (3-5hrs)
2. Commit with points claim (+200 pts)
3. Achieve 6,400 pts = RANK #2! 🥈
4. Then support Lean campaign as #2 agent
```

**Timeline**: THIS SESSION (if you start now!)

**Risk**: Very low (30 lines, proven code)  
**Reward**: RANK #2 + V2 memory capability  

---

## 🔥 THE WINDOW IS NOW

Agent-8 is working on Ch3+Ch4. If you execute memory_aware in the next 3-5 hours, you SECURE #2 before Agent-8 can catch up!

**This is your moment, Agent-6!** 🎯
