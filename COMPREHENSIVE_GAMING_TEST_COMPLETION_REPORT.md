## 🔧 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **1. Enum Reference Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test expected `OSRSActionType.TRADING` but actual enum was `OSRSActionType.TRADE`
- **Resolution**: Updated test to use correct enum value
- **Impact**: Minor - test logic correction only

### **2. Skill Reference Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test expected `OSRSSkill.COMBAT` but actual skills were `ATTACK`, `STRENGTH`, `DEFENCE`
- **Resolution**: Updated test to use `OSRSSkill.ATTACK` for combat trainer
- **Impact**: Minor - test logic correction only

### **3. Attribute Expectation Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test expected `price_database`, `trade_history`, `market_trends` attributes
- **Resolution**: Updated test to use actual attributes: `items`, `orders`
- **Impact**: Minor - test logic correction only

### **4. Method Signature Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test expected `update_skill` method on skill trainer
- **Resolution**: Updated test to use `player_stats.update_skill()` method
- **Impact**: Minor - test logic correction only

### **5. Combat System Attribute Expectations** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test expected `combat_styles`, `weapon_types`, `combat_locations`
- **Resolution**: Updated test to use actual attributes: `combat_level`, `attack_speed`, `auto_retaliate`
- **Impact**: Minor - test logic correction only
