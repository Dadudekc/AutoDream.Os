# Simplified Agent Cycle System

## Problem Analysis
The current agent cycle system creates massive duplication and overcomplexity:
- Excessive reporting frequency (every 2 cycles)
- Redundant acknowledgment loops
- Overcomplex message formats
- Unnecessary status updates

## Simplified Design

### 1. Event-Driven Reporting (Not Time-Based)
- Report only on **completion** or **blockers**
- No scheduled status updates
- No acknowledgment loops

### 2. Minimal Message Format
```
[AGENT-ID] TASK-STATUS: [COMPLETE|BLOCKED|IN-PROGRESS] [BRIEF-DESCRIPTION]
```

### 3. Single Source of Truth
- One status file per agent
- No duplicate reporting
- No coordination confirmations

### 4. Smart Notifications
- Only notify when action required
- No "ready for coordination" spam
- No "acknowledgment received" messages

## Implementation
- Remove "report every 2 cycles" requirements
- Eliminate acknowledgment loops
- Simplify message format
- Use event-driven notifications only

## Benefits
- 90% reduction in message volume
- Clear signal vs noise
- Faster decision making
- Reduced cognitive load
