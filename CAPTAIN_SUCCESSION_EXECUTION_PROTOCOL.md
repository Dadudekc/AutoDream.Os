## ðŸ“‹ **INCOMING CAPTAIN EXECUTION ORDERS (FIRST 24 HOURS)**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation (Hours 1-4)**

#### **1.1 Discord Infrastructure Check**
```bash
# Execute comprehensive Discord validation
python tools/env_inference_tool.py

```

#### **1.3 Cursor Task Database Status**
```bash

python tools/cursor_task_database_integration.py

# Verify database integrity
sqlite3 unified.db ".tables"

# Check FSM state integration
sqlite3 unified.db "SELECT * FROM fsm_task_tracking;"
```

#### **1.4 Agent Coordination Test**
```bash
# Test messaging system functionality
python messaging_system.py Agent-4 Agent-5 "Captain succession test - validate agent coordination" HIGH

# Verify devlog posting across agents
python src/services/agent_devlog_posting.py --agent agent-4 --action "CAPTAIN SUCCESSION PROTOCOL INITIATED - Infrastructure validation in progress"
```

### **Phase 2: System Understanding & Documentation (Hours 5-12)**

#### **2.1 Project Scanner Analysis Protocol**
```bash
# Create project scan tasks for maintenance
python tools/cursor_task_database_integration.py

# Generate Captain execution orders
# Access method: manager.generate_captain_execution_orders()

# Expected Task Categories:
# - File complexity reduction (AGENTS.md: 1739 lines)
# - Dependency issues (python-dotenv versioning)
# - Documentation updates (outdated docs/)
# - Tool maintenance (tools/ directory)
```

#### **2.2 FSM State Management Understanding**
```python
# Core Agent States to understand:
AgentState.ONBOARDING      = "ONBOARDING"
AgentState.ACTIVE          = "ACTIVE" 
AgentState.CONTRACT_EXECUTION_ACTIVE = "CONTRACT_EXECUTION_ACTIVE"
AgentState.SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED = "SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED"
AgentState.PAUSED          = "PAUSED"
AgentState.ERROR           = "ERROR"
AgentState.RESET           = "RESET"
AgentState.SHUTDOWN        = "SHUTDOWN"

# Valid Transitions (CRITICAL):
ONBOARDING â†’ ACTIVE, ERROR, SHUTDOWN
ACTIVE â†’ CONTRACT_EXECUTION_ACTIVE, PAUSED, ERROR, SHUTDOWN
CONTRACT_EXECUTION_ACTIVE â†’ SURVEY_MISSION_COMPLETED, ACTIVE, ERROR, SHUTDOWN
# See: src/fsm/fsm_messaging_integration.py for complete transition matrix
```

#### **2.3 Agent Role Assignment Protocol**
```python
# Dynamic Role Categories (assign per task, not permanently):
Core Roles: CAPTAIN, SSOT_MANAGER, COORDINATOR
Technical Roles: INTEGRATION_SPECIALIST, ARCHITECTURE_SPECIALIST  
Operational Roles: TASK_EXECUTOR, QUALITY_ASSURANCE
# Reference: docs/agents_modular/role_assignment.md
```

### **Phase 3: Active Operations & Monitoring (Hours 13-24)**

#### **3.1 Autonomous Task Management Protocol**
```bash
# Create proactive maintenance tasks
python tools/cursor_task_database_integration.py

# Integration with project scanner:
# Automatically creates tasks from:
# - Complexity alerts (files >400 lines)
# - Dependency issues  
# - Architecture violations
# - Performance bottlenecks

# Integration with FSM:
# Tracks task state transitions:
# CREATED â†’ ASSIGNED â†’ ACTIVE â†’ COMPLETED
# With validation and rollback capabilities
```

#### **3.2 Execution Mode Protocol Enforcement**
```yaml
# Execute Mode Protocol (Anti-Theater):
execution_mode:
  enabled: true
  strict_mode: true
  
  hard_stops:
    max_acknowledgments: 1
    loop_detection_threshold: 3
    
  outcome_enforcement:
    require_measurable_results: true
    
  termination_triggers:
    execution_complete_signals:
      - "Task complete" 
      - "Files removed successfully"
# Reference: EXECUTION_MODE_PROTOCOL.yaml
```

#### **3.3 Captain Decision Making Framework**
```python
# Captain Authority Levels:
1. STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT: Task assignment, role allocation
2. EMERGENCY INTERVENTION: Override agent actions during crisis
3. SYSTEM MONITORING: Agent performance, system health  
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE: Ensure V2 compliance (â‰¤400 lines, â‰¤5 classes)

# Decision Documentation:
- Update docs/CAPTAINS_LOG.md after major milestone
- Record rationale for all emergency interventions
- Maintain agent performance correlation data
# Reference: docs/CAPTAINS_HANDBOOK.md v2.3
```

2. Verify bot token validity in environment
3. Test default webhook functionality
4. Contact Discord server administrator
5. Execute emergency rollback procedures
```

### **Agent Coordination Breakdown**
```bash
# If agent messaging system failures:

1. Run: Enhanced scanner components individually  
2. Check: Database integrity (unified.db)
3. Verify: FSM state machine operation
4. Fallback: Manual project analysis until automated repair
5. Plan: Scanner system restart procedures
