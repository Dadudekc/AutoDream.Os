**Answer**: Yes, the TODO cleanup message was an error. It may have been meant for another agent or was simply a mistake in my tracking.

### **Question 2: Should I coordinate with Agent-5 on FSMOrchestrator?**
**Answer**: No need unless you see a specific coordination opportunity. Focus on your GUI module consolidation per the project scan orders.

### **Question 3: What are the actual TODOs you're referring to?**
**Answer**: There were no TODOs for you. The message was incorrect. Your actual work (Vision System, Integration Playbook, cleanup, docs) is what counts.
