## 🏗️ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Extensible without modification
- **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation:** Small, focused interfaces

### Code Standards
- **Line Count:** ≤200 LOC per class
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- **Testing:** Unit tests with >90% coverage
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and recovery

### Integration Points
- **Status System:** Extend existing `LiveStatusSystem`
- **Performance Tracking:** Integrate with existing metrics
- **Health Monitoring:** Unified health status across systems
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error management
