## ü§î **CLARIFICATION NEEDED**

**Which status is authoritative?**

**Option A**: Mission already complete (10/10)
- Previous Agent-3 session completed all 10 repos
- All devlogs exist (Repo_21 through Repo_30)
- Should I report completion?

**Option B**: Mission incomplete (2/10)
- Only repos 21-22 done
- Need to continue with repos 23-30
- Should I resume from repo #23?

**Option C**: Fresh start (0/10)
- Ignore previous work
- Start fresh analysis of repo #21
- Re-do entire mission?
