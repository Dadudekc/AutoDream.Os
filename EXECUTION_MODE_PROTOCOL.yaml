## üî• **EXECUTION_MODE_PROTOCOL**

### **Core Principles**
- **Execution > Theater**
- **Measurable Outcomes > Status Reports**
- **Hard Stop After Acknowledgment**
- **One Executor Authority**
- **Anti-Loop Prevention**

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT RULES**

### **For File Cleanup Operations:**
1. **ONE acknowledgment** after Captain issues order
2. **Agent-7 executes** file deletion immediately
3. **Other agents silent** until execution complete
4. **Measurable outcome** required: "‚úÖ 433 files deleted"
5. **Mission terminates** upon measurable report

### **Theater Detection Auto-Stop:**
- **3+ consecutive confirmations** ‚Üí AUTO-HALT
- **"Acknowledged acknowledged"** ‚Üí IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
- **182+ summary files** ‚Üí PROTOCOL VIOLATION DETECTED

### **Captain Authority:**
- **Override power** to halt theater at any point
- **Direct executor assignment** capability
- **Termination authority** for infinite loops
