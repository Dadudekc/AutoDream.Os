- **Pending**: Agent-1, Agent-5, Agent-8 (YOU)

**Your Perspective Needed**: SSOT/Quality lens
- Single Source of Truth easier with 30 repos?
- System integration complexity?
- Quality standards maintainability?

---

## üìä **KEY CONTEXT**

**Agent-2's Finding**: ALL 75 repos fail architecture (0-20/100)
- Massive SSOT violations
- No quality gates
- Complete rewrites needed

**Infrastructure Impact** (Agent-3 analysis):
- 60% archive = Focus on SSOT for 30 repos
- 30 repos = Achievable quality standards
- 75 repos = SSOT nightmare across too many systems

**SSOT Perspective**: 
- Better to enforce SSOT across 30 repos professionally
- Than to have SSOT violations across 75 repos
- Quality over quantity for system integration!
