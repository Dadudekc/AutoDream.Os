**Unique Selling Point**: The project implements a **coordinate-based multi-agent system** where 8 AI agents are positioned at specific pixel coordinates across dual monitors in the Cursor IDE, enabling real-time coordination through PyAutoGUI automation.

```
Multi-Monitor Coordinate System:
Monitor 1 (Left):           Monitor 2 (Right):
‚îú‚îÄ Agent-1 (-1269, 481)    ‚îú‚îÄ Agent-5 (652, 421)
‚îú‚îÄ Agent-2 (-308, 480)     ‚îú‚îÄ Agent-6 (1612, 419)
‚îú‚îÄ Agent-3 (-1269, 1001)   ‚îú‚îÄ Agent-7 (920, 851)
