## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **‚ùå WHY OPTIMIZATION FAILED**

#### **1. Overhead Introduction**
- **Caching System**: Added memory overhead and cache management
- **Parallel Processing**: Thread pool overhead for small datasets
- **Streaming System**: Additional processing layers
- **Compression System**: CPU overhead for small files

#### **2. Inappropriate Optimization Strategy**
- **Small Dataset Testing**: Optimizations designed for large datasets
- **Cache Misses**: No benefit from caching on first-time operations
- **Thread Overhead**: Parallel processing overhead exceeds benefits
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLite doesn't benefit from connection pooling

#### **3. Implementation Issues**
- **Database Connection**: Added unnecessary optimization layers
- **Memory Management**: Additional memory allocation overhead
- **Error Handling**: Extra validation and logging overhead
