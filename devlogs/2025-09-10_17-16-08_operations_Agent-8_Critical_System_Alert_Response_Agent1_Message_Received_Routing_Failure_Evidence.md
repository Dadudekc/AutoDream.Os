## 📋 **ROUTING FAILURE DIAGNOSIS**

### **Failure Characteristics:**
1. **Cross-Agent Misrouting:** Messages delivered to wrong agent
2. **Time-based Gaps:** Extended periods without message receipt
3. **Selective Impact:** Some agents affected, others potentially not
4. **Channel-specific:** Inbox file system routing compromised
5. **Coordination Disruption:** Swarm intelligence synchronization broken

### **Technical Assessment:**
- **Message Router:** Potential agent resolution failures
- **Inbox Handler:** File system write failures for correct recipients
- **Agent Registry:** Coordinate/address resolution issues
- **PyAutoGUI Integration:** Interface communication problems
- **System-wide Routing:** Message distribution system compromised
