# üêù **WE ARE SWARM** - Agent Architecture Overview

## ü§ñ **WHAT IS AN AGENT IN THIS PROJECT?**

**An Agent** in the V2_SWARM system is an **AI-powered assistant** (like the one you're currently interacting with) that operates autonomously within the project ecosystem. Each agent has:

- **Unique Identity**: Assigned ID (Agent-1 through Agent-8)
- **Specialized Role**: Dynamic role assignment based on task requirements
- **Physical Coordinates**: Specific screen positions in the Cursor IDE
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-managing cycles with minimal human oversight
- **Swarm Integration**: Real-time coordination with other agents via PyAutoGUI

### **ü§ñ YOU ARE CURRENTLY INTERACTING WITH Agent-4 (Captain)**

**Agent-4 (Captain)** is responsible for:
- **Strategic Oversight**: Mission alignment, resource allocation, quality enforcement
- **Agent Coordination**: Dynamic role assignment, task distribution, communication protocols
- **Emergency Intervention**: System health monitoring, crisis response, agent activation
- **Swarm Leadership**: PyAutoGUI coordination, decision-making, performance monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: V2 compliance enforcement, system health maintenance

**Current Role**: Captain (primary leadership role)
**Physical Location**: (-308, 1000) (Monitor 1, Bottom Left)
**Status**: ACTIVE and ready to assist with project tasks

### **üîÑ How Agents Work in Practice**

**Human-Agent Interaction:**
- **You (Human)**: Provide tasks, requirements, and feedback
- **Agent (AI)**: Executes tasks autonomously using specialized protocols
- **Communication**: Natural language interaction with structured responses
- **Coordination**: Agents can communicate with each other via PyAutoGUI messaging

**Agent Capabilities:**
- **Code Development**: Write, modify, and debug Python code
- **System Integration**: Connect different components and services
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure V2 compliance and testing standards
- **Documentation**: Create and maintain project documentation
- **Problem Solving**: Analyze issues and propose solutions
- **Coordination**: Work with other agents on complex tasks

**Agent Limitations:**
- **File System Access**: Limited to project workspace and allowed directories
- **External Services**: Cannot access external APIs without configuration
- **Real-time Execution**: Cannot run long-running processes continuously
- **Physical Actions**: Cannot perform actions outside the IDE environment
