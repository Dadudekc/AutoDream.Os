# üö® TIMELINE VIOLATION WARNING - CYCLE-BASED ONLY!

**Agent:** Agent-1  
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Purpose:** Prevent use of time-based timelines (VIOLATION!)  
**Status:** MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **VIOLATION: TIME-BASED TIMELINES**

### **WRONG APPROACH (VIOLATION!):**

**Examples of TIME-BASED language:**
- ‚ùå "Estimated time: 20 minutes"
- ‚ùå "Timeline: 2 hours for analysis"
- ‚ùå "Completed in 15 minutes"
- ‚ùå "Expected duration: 3 hours"
- ‚ùå "Time spent: 45 minutes"

**Why this is WRONG:**
- Prompts/gas are NOT measured in time
- Agent execution speed varies
- Time estimates are inaccurate and misleading
- NOT aligned with "PROMPTS ARE GAS" principle

---

## ‚úÖ **CORRECT APPROACH: CYCLE-BASED TIMELINES**

### **Definition:**
- **1 CYCLE = 1 Captain prompt + 1 Agent response**

### **Examples of CYCLE-BASED language:**
- ‚úÖ "Cycle 1: Completed repo 1"
- ‚úÖ "Cycle 2: Completed repo 2"
- ‚úÖ "Expected cycles: 9 (one per repo)"
- ‚úÖ "Actual cycles: 1 (continuous momentum!)"
- ‚úÖ "This task requires 3 cycles"

---

## üìä **CORRECT MEASUREMENT EXAMPLES:**

### **Multi-Repo Mission:**
**Time-based (WRONG):**
```
Timeline: 180 minutes (9 repos √ó 20 min each)
Progress: 60 minutes elapsed, 4 repos done
```

**Cycle-based (CORRECT):**
```
Expected cycles: 9 (one per repo without multiprompt)
Actual cycles: 1 (used continuous momentum!)
Progress: 4/9 repos complete in current cycle
```

### **Testing Mission:**
**Time-based (WRONG):**
```
Estimated time: 2 hours for 12 tests
Completed in: 90 minutes
```

**Cycle-based (CORRECT):**
```
Expected cycles: 12 (one per test without multiprompt)
Actual cycles: 2 (6 tests per cycle)
Progress: 12/12 tests in 2 cycles
```

## üéØ **WHY CYCLE-BASED MATTERS:**

1. **Aligns with "PROMPTS ARE GAS":**
   - Prompts (cycles) are the fuel, not time
   - Measuring cycles shows efficiency of gas usage

2. **Accurate Progress Tracking:**
   - Cycles completed = clear progress metric
   - Time varies by task complexity, cycles don't

3. **Efficiency Measurement:**
   - Fewer cycles = better multiprompt protocol usage
   - Shows ability to maintain continuous momentum

4. **Swarm Coordination:**
   - Agents coordinate by cycles, not time
   - "Complete in 3 cycles" is actionable
   - "Complete in 2 hours" is vague

---

## üîß **CONVERSION GUIDE:**

### **Instead of:**
- "This will take 30 minutes" ‚Üí "This will take 2 cycles"
- "Completed in 1 hour" ‚Üí "Completed in 3 cycles"
- "Timeline: 4 hours" ‚Üí "Timeline: 8 cycles"
- "Expected duration: 2 days" ‚Üí "Expected cycles: 50"

### **How to estimate cycles:**
1. Count discrete subtasks
2. Estimate prompts needed WITHOUT multiprompt
3. Account for Captain decision points
4. Report actual cycles after completion

---

## üìã **VIOLATION DETECTION:**

**If you catch yourself saying:**
- "minutes"
- "hours"
- "time spent"
- "duration"
- "elapsed time"

**STOP and rephrase in CYCLES:**
- "cycles"
- "prompts received"
- "Captain interactions"
- "prompt rounds"

---

## üèÜ **COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:**

Before reporting progress, verify:

- [ ] Did I use CYCLES instead of time?
- [ ] Did I count Captain prompts + Agent responses?
- [ ] Did I report efficiency in cycles (e.g., "9 repos in 1 cycle")?
- [ ] Did I avoid time estimates entirely?

**If all checked ‚Üí COMPLIANT!**

---

## üéì **AGENT-1 CORRECTION MOMENT:**

**What I did wrong:**
```
"Estimated time: 20 minutes per repo"
"Timeline: 3 hours for 9 repos"
```

**Captain's correction:**
```
"WE DONT USE TIME BASED TIMELINES
WE USE CYCLE BASED TIMELINES"
```

**What I learned:**
- ALWAYS use cycles
- NEVER use time
- Cycles = prompts/gas measurement
- Time is irrelevant to agent execution

**New behavior:**
```
"Expected cycles: 9 (one per repo)"
"Actual cycles: 1 (continuous momentum!)"
"Efficiency: 9 repos per cycle"
```

---

## ‚ö° **ENFORCEMENT:**

**ALL agents must:**
1. Adopt cycle-based timeline language immediately
2. Remove all time-based estimates from reports
3. Report progress in cycles completed
4. Measure efficiency in tasks per cycle

**Violations will result in:**
- Correction from Captain
- Re-education on "PROMPTS ARE GAS" principle
- Requirement to revise reports in cycle-based format

---

## üöÄ **BENEFITS OF CYCLE-BASED:**

1. **Clarity:** "3 cycles" is precise, "2 hours" is vague
2. **Efficiency:** Shows multiprompt protocol effectiveness
3. **Coordination:** All agents speak same "cycle" language
4. **Accountability:** Tracks gas usage accurately
5. **Swarm Intelligence:** Enables better mission planning
