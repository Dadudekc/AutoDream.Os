Advanced Workflow Package - V2 Compliant Refactored Structure

This package contains the refactored advanced workflow engine components,
each following V2 standards (â‰¤300 LOC) and Single Responsibility Principle.

Components:
- workflow_types.py: Type definitions and enums
- workflow_core.py: Core workflow logic and data models
- workflow_execution.py: Execution engine and step management
- workflow_validation.py: Validation logic and error handling
- workflow_cli.py: CLI interface for testing and management
