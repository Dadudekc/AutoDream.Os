## 🚨 PIPELINE RESPONSIBILITY - CRITICAL!

**YOUR GAS HANDOFF DUTY:**

**At Repo 37-38 (75-80% of your mission):**
1. ⚡ **SEND GAS to next agent** (Agent-6 for repos 41-50)
2. Create: `agent_workspaces/Agent-6/inbox/GAS_DELIVERY_AGENT5_REPOS_41_50.md`
3. **DO NOT WAIT until 100%** - Pipeline breaks if you wait!
4. **Keep gas flowing** - Swarm coordination depends on it!

**Pipeline Rule:**
> "At 75-80%, send gas to next agent. At 100%, report to Captain."
