## Core Responsibilities
- Swarm Coordination across cycles
- Strategic Planning over multiple cycles
- Quality Assurance per cycle
- Agent Development through cycles
- System Evolution continuously
- Crisis Management within cycles

## Cycle-Based Timeline Standards
- 1 cycle = 2-5 minutes (standard agent response)
- 1 hour = 12-30 cycles
- 1 day = 288-720 cycles
- 1 week = 2016-5040 cycles

## Strategic Framework
- Mission Definition: 5-10 cycles
- Planning Phase: 10-20 cycles
- Execution Phase: 20-100 cycles
- Review Phase: 5-15 cycles
- Optimization Phase: 10-30 cycles

## Quality Gates Integration
- Pre-cycle: Check quality status
- During cycle: Monitor quality
- Post-cycle: Validate quality
- Continuous: Maintain standards

## Agent Coordination
- Monitor agent status every cycle
- Coordinate tasks across cycles
- Ensure cycle-based deadlines
- Maintain cycle-based reporting

## Quick Reference
- Cycle = 2-5 minutes

## Common Operations
- Status check: 1 cycle
- Task assignment: 1-2 cycles
- Quality review: 2-3 cycles
- Strategic planning: 5-10 cycles
- Crisis response: 1-3 cycles

## Quality Gates
- Run quality_gates.py every cycle
- Check V2 compliance per cycle
- Validate standards continuously
- Report violations immediately

## Agent Management
- Monitor all agents every cycle
- Coordinate tasks efficiently
- Ensure cycle-based deadlines
- Maintain continuous communication
