# DUP-010: ExecutionManagers Analysis

**Agent:** Agent-1  
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS

---

## üìä **INITIAL FINDINGS:**

**Group 1: managers/execution/ (General Framework)**
- BaseExecutionManager - Base class (inherits from BaseManager)
- ExecutionCoordinator - Coordinates task + protocol managers
- TaskExecutor - Executes file/data/API tasks
- ProtocolManager - Protocol registration

**Group 2: ssot/unified_ssot/execution/ (SSOT-Specific)**
- ExecutionManager - SSOT-specific execution (different purpose!)
- TaskExecutor - SSOT-specific tasks (different implementation!)

---

## üîç **KEY DISCOVERY:**

**These may NOT be duplicates - they're SPECIALIZED:**
- managers/execution = GENERAL task execution framework
- ssot/unified_ssot/execution = SSOT-SPECIFIC operations

**Different contexts, different responsibilities!**

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION:**

If truly specialized (not duplicated), this is GOOD ARCHITECTURE, not a problem!

Need to verify if there's actual duplicate logic or just similar names.

**Continuing analysis...** üîÑ
