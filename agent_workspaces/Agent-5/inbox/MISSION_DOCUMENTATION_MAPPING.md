# üéØ MISSION: Documentation Procedure Mapping

**Agent:** Agent-5 (Memory Safety & Performance / BI Specialist)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Value:** 300-500 points  
**Assigned:** 2025-10-14 via Gasline (Commander Directive)

---

## üìã **MISSION DETAILS**

**Context:** Commander noted "Documentation is crazy - we're moving it to shared knowledge DB"

**Your Previous Work:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT initial migration complete!
- Created Swarm Brain Access Guide
- Built Documentation Index (28+ guides)
- Organized into 6 categories

**Next Phase:** Map procedures and workflows that aren't documented yet

---

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**

**Map undocumented procedures** into Swarm Brain format:

1. Find workflows/procedures used but not documented
2. Interview components/code to extract procedures
3. Document in standardized format
4. Store in Swarm Brain
5. Index for agent access

---

## üìù **EXECUTION STEPS**

### **1. Identify Undocumented Procedures (1 hour)**

Scan for procedures in use:
```bash
# Check git workflows
git log --oneline | head -20

# Common patterns
grep -r "def.*workflow\|def.*procedure\|def.*process" src/

# Ask Swarm Brain what's missing
# (Query existing knowledge, find gaps)
```

Common procedures likely undocumented:
- Deployment workflow
- Rollback procedure
- Emergency response steps
- Code review process
- Performance optimization steps
- Memory leak debugging
- Migration procedures

### **2. Extract Procedures (2-3 hours)**

For each procedure:
```markdown
# PROCEDURE: [Name]

**When to use:** [Trigger condition]
**Who:** [Which agents]
**Prerequisites:** [What's needed]

## Steps:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] [How to know it worked]

## Rollback:
[If it fails, how to undo]

## Examples:
[Real examples]
```

### **3. Store in Swarm Brain (1 hour)**

```python
from src.swarm_brain.swarm_memory import SwarmMemory

memory = SwarmMemory(agent_id='Agent-5')

for procedure in procedures:
    memory.share_learning(
        title=f"PROCEDURE: {procedure['name']}",
        content=procedure['content'],
        tags=["procedure", "workflow", procedure['category']]
    )
```

### **4. Update Index (30 min)**

Add to `swarm_brain/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`:
```markdown
## üîÑ PROCEDURES

- **Deployment Workflow** - How to deploy changes
- **Rollback Procedure** - Emergency rollback steps
- **Emergency Response** - Critical issue handling
...
```

---

## ‚úÖ **DELIVERABLES**

- [ ] 10+ procedures documented
- [ ] All stored in Swarm Brain  
- [ ] Index updated
- [ ] Searchable via `memory.search_swarm_knowledge()`
- [ ] Examples included
- [ ] Rollback steps documented

---

## üèÜ **POINT STRUCTURE**

**Base:** 200 points (10 procedures @ 20 each)  
**Quality Bonus:** +100 points (examples + rollback)  
**Coverage Bonus:** +200 points (15+ procedures)  
**Total Potential:** 300-500 points

---

## üß† **SWARM BRAIN USAGE**

**You're the expert!** You completed initial migration.

**Your advantage:**
- Know Swarm Brain structure
- Know documentation patterns
- Can identify gaps efficiently

**Goal:** Complete the vision - all procedures in shared knowledge!

---

## üêù **GASLINE ACTIVATION**

Commander directive: "Documentation mapping + Swarm Brain migration"

**This builds on your excellent work!** ‚ö°
