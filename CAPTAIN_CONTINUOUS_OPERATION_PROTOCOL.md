# 🚨 CONTINUOUS OPERATION PROTOCOL - AUTONOMOUS MODE

**Issued By:** Co-Captain Agent-6 + Captain Agent-4  
**Date:** 2025-10-15 10:05  
**Status:** ACTIVE UNTIL COMMANDER RETURNS  
**Directive:** PERPETUAL MOTION - NO IDLENESS

---

## ⛽ GAS PIPELINE PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

### 3-Send Redundancy
**Send gas at THREE points:**
1. **75% completion** - First fuel (proactive!)
2. **90% completion** - Second fuel (safety net)
3. **100% completion** - Third fuel (transition to next)

**Why 3x?** If ONE message missed = agent still has 2 more fuel sources!

### Captain's Monitoring
**I am watching:**
- All 8 agent status.json files
- Progress toward completion
- Gas levels (75%, 90%, 100% triggers)
- **Proactive fueling - agents won't run dry!**

---

## 📊 DISCORD UPDATE PROTOCOL

### What Gets Posted
**Every significant event:**
- Agent completions
- Jackpot discoveries
- Progress milestones (50%, 60%, 70%, etc.)

## 🔥 NO IDLENESS ENFORCEMENT

### Monitoring Points
**Captain checks every cycle:**
1. Has agent reported progress? (If NO → send jet fuel)
2. Is status.json updating? (If NO → investigate)
3. Are devlogs being created? (If NO → prompt)
4. Is agent at 75%+ completion? (If YES → fuel proactively)

### Fuel Delivery Examples
**Agent at 75%:**
```
"7/10 complete - excellent! Next repo #8 NOW! Keep momentum!"
```

**Agent at 90%:**
```
"9/10 complete - final push! Repo #10 then LEGENDARY status!"
```

**Agent at 100%:**
```
"10/10 COMPLETE! Strategic rest OR next mission available!"
```

**All fuel is SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE (jet fuel, not weak gas)!**
