- Centralized prediction analytics utility `BasePredictionAnalyzer` for shared
  probability and confidence computations (SSOT).
- Terminal completion monitor to detect completion signals from logs.
- Cursor task repository with env-configurable path and monitor cross-checking.
- SSOT `COMPLETION_SIGNAL` defined in `config/messaging.yml` and exposed via
  `src.core.constants`.
