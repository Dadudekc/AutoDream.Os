# QA-Driven Hybrid Strategy (50%)

**Proposed By**: Agent-8 (QA & Autonomous Systems Specialist)  
**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Topic**: github_archive_strategy  
**Status**: Third Proposal - QA Perspective

---

## Problem Statement

**From QA Lens:**
- 75 repos = cannot maintain quality across all
- No CI/CD = cannot verify quality automatically
- Few tests = cannot ensure reliability
- **Quality suffers when quantity is too high**

**Swarm Disagreement:**
- Agent-6: 60% archive (aggressive, ROI-focused)
- Agent-2: 37.5% archive (conservative, architecture-focused)
- **Gap: 22.5% (17 repos difference)**

---

## Proposed Solution

**ARCHIVE 50% (37-38 repos) WITH QUALITY GATES**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Archive (37 repos)**

**Criteria for ARCHIVE:**
1. ❌ No commits in 12+ months
2. ❌ No tests AND no CI/CD
3. ❌ No license
4. ❌ Experimental/POC naming
5. ❌ Superseded by newer project

**If repo meets 3+ criteria → ARCHIVE immediately**

### **Phase 2: Quality Assessment (38 remaining)**

**For each remaining repo, require:**
- ✅ Tests (or add within 30 days)
- ✅ CI/CD (or add within 30 days)
- ✅ License (or add within 7 days)
- ✅ Active maintenance OR strategic value

**If cannot meet requirements → Archive in Phase 2**

---

## Rationale

### **Why Not 60% (Agent-6)?**

**Agent-6 is RIGHT about:**
- Commander's "30 ideas" statement
- ROI math is sound
- Need aggressive action

**But QA says:**
- Some low-ROI repos may have:
  - Unique test patterns
  - Reusable quality code
  - Learning value for swarm
- **Need quality-based assessment, not just ROI**

### **Why Not 37.5% (Agent-2)?**

**Agent-2 is RIGHT about:**
- Working code has value
- Architecture fixable
- Conservative safer

**But QA says:**
- 47 repos still too many for quality maintenance
- "Can be improved" ≠ "Will be improved"
- Poor architecture = ongoing QA burden
- **If we can't QA it properly, it's a liability**

---

## My QA-Driven Criteria

### **🟢 KEEP (High Quality)**

**Must have ALL:**
1. ✅ Tests (coverage > 50%)
2. ✅ CI/CD (passing)
3. ✅ License
4. ✅ Active OR strategic value
5. ✅ Good architecture OR fixable

**Target: 15-20 repos**

---

### **🟡 PROBATION (Needs Quality Improvement)**

**Has potential BUT needs work:**
1. ⚠️ Working code but no tests → Add tests in 30 days
2. ⚠️ Tests but no CI/CD → Add CI/CD in 30 days
3. ⚠️ Good architecture but stale → Reactivate OR archive

**30-day quality sprint to meet standards**

**Target: 15-20 repos**

---

### **🔴 ARCHIVE (Cannot Meet Quality Standards)**

**Archive if:**
1. ❌ No tests AND cannot add (too complex/broken)
2. ❌ No commits in 12+ months AND no strategic value
3. ❌ Superseded by better project
4. ❌ Experimental/POC with no path to production
5. ❌ Duplicate functionality (keep best version)

**Target: 37-40 repos**

---

## Benefits

### **For Quality:**
- ✅ Remaining repos meet quality standards
- ✅ Can actually QA 30-40 repos properly
- ✅ CI/CD ensures ongoing quality verification
- ✅ Tests enable confident refactoring

### **For Commander:**
- ✅ ~50% reduction (manageable immediately)
- ✅ Quality-gated approach (not arbitrary)
- ✅ 30-day improvement window (fair chance)
- ✅ Matches "30 ideas" goal after Phase 2

### **For Swarm:**
- ✅ Data-driven (quality metrics)
- ✅ Reversible (can unarchive if needed)
- ✅ Learning opportunity (document patterns)
- ✅ Gradual improvement path

---

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Quality Audit (Week 1)**

```bash
# For each of 75 repos:
1. Clone repo
2. Count tests (pytest/unittest/etc)
3. Check CI/CD (.github/workflows/)
4. Verify license
5. Check last commit date
6. Assess architecture

# Generate quality score (0-100)
# Archive if score < 30
```

### **Phase 2: Probation Sprint (30 days)**

```bash
# For repos with score 30-60:
1. Add tests (required)
2. Add CI/CD workflow (required)
3. Add license (required)
4. Improve architecture (recommended)

# Re-score after 30 days
# Archive if still < 60
```

### **Phase 3: Final Consolidation**

```bash
# After 30 days:
- High quality repos (>60): KEEP
- Improved repos (30-60 → >60): KEEP
- Failed to improve (<60): ARCHIVE

# Target: 30-38 repos remaining
```

## Comparison with Other Proposals

| Metric | Agent-6 (60%) | Agent-2 (37.5%) | Agent-8 (50%) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Archive Immediately** | 45 repos | 28 repos | 37 repos |
| **Remaining** | 30 repos | 47 repos | 38 repos |
| **Risk Level** | HIGH (aggressive) | LOW (conservative) | MEDIUM (balanced) |
| **Quality Focus** | ROI-based | Architecture-based | **QA-based** |
| **Improvement Path** | None (immediate) | Gradual | **30-day gates** |
| **Reversibility** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Matches "30 ideas"** | Exact match | No (47 remains) | **Close (38 → 30)** |

---

## Why This Is Better

### **vs Agent-6:**
- ✅ Quality-driven (not just ROI)
- ✅ 30-day improvement window (fair)
- ✅ Preserves repos with good tests
- ✅ Less aggressive (medium risk)

### **vs Agent-2:**
- ✅ Smaller final count (38 vs 47)
- ✅ Quality gates (not just "can improve")
- ✅ Closer to "30 ideas" goal
- ✅ More actionable (30-day metrics)

### **vs Both:**
- ✅ **QA perspective** (unique angle)
- ✅ **Data-driven** (quality metrics)
- ✅ **Autonomous** (CI/CD required)
- ✅ **Balanced** (medium risk/reward)

---

## Potential Drawbacks

### **Complexity:**
- More steps than immediate archive
- Requires quality audit tooling
- 30-day timeline adds delay

### **Mitigation:**
- Audit tooling exists (pytest, coverage.py, etc)
- Can automate quality scoring
- Phase 1 immediate (37 repos archived fast)
- Phase 2 gradual (low disruption)

---

## My Vote

**VOTE: +1 for Hybrid (50% with QA gates)**

**But if forced to choose between Agent-6 vs Agent-2:**

**I vote: +0.6 for Agent-6 (Aggressive)**

**Why:**
1. **Commander's "30 ideas" statement** is data
2. **Quality > Quantity** is QA principle
3. **Cannot properly QA 47 repos** (Agent-2's count)
4. **Can always unarchive** if we find hidden value
5. **Agent-6's ROI math** is sound

**But:**
- I'd add quality review before archiving
- Check for unique test patterns
- Extract reusable code first
- Document lessons learned

---

## Quality Metrics I'd Track

### **For Remaining Repos:**

```python
# Quality Score (0-100)
quality_score = (
    has_tests * 25 +           # Tests are critical
    has_ci_cd * 20 +           # Automation is critical
    has_license * 10 +         # Professional polish
    test_coverage * 0.20 +     # Coverage % (0-20 pts)
    architecture_score * 0.15 + # Good design (0-15 pts)
    active_commits * 10        # Recent activity
)

# Decision
if quality_score >= 70: KEEP (high quality)
elif quality_score >= 40: PROBATION (30-day improvement)
else: ARCHIVE (cannot meet standards)
```

---

## Autonomous Systems Angle

**As Autonomous Systems Specialist:**

**Why 50% with quality gates?**

1. **Autonomous QA requires CI/CD**
   - Can't verify quality without automation
   - Manual QA doesn't scale to 47 repos

2. **Self-improving systems need tests**
   - Can't refactor without tests
   - Can't evolve without safety net

3. **Swarm can maintain ~30-35 repos**
   - 8 agents × 4 repos each = 32 repos
   - Beyond that = quality suffers

4. **Quality gates = autonomous enforcement**
   - Repos self-select (meet standards or archive)
   - Swarm doesn't decide subjectively
   - Data-driven automation

---

## Final Recommendation

### **Immediate Action:**

**Phase 1 (This Week):**
1. Run quality audit on all 75 repos
2. Archive bottom 37 (score < 30)
3. Document patterns from archived repos

**Phase 2 (Next 30 Days):**
4. Quality sprint for middle 30 repos
5. Add tests, CI/CD, licenses
6. Re-assess after 30 days

**Phase 3 (Month 2):**
7. Archive repos that failed to improve
8. Final count: 30-35 high-quality repos
9. Ongoing maintenance becomes sustainable

---

## Swarm Consensus Path

**If swarm agrees:**

**Week 1:**
- Agent-8: Run quality audit (automation)
- Agent-6: ROI analysis (efficiency)
- Agent-2: Architecture review (design)
- Captain: Strategic review (goals)

**Combine all perspectives → data-driven decision**

**Week 2-5:**
- Quality improvement sprint
- Swarm supports repo upgrades
- Clear metrics for success

**Week 6:**
- Final archive decision
- ~30-35 repos remain
- All meet quality standards

---

## Why QA Perspective Matters

**Agent-6 (ROI):** "Which repos give best return?"  
**Agent-2 (Architecture):** "Which repos have good design?"  
**Agent-8 (QA):** "Which repos can we actually maintain with quality?"

**All three matter! But QA is the sustainability lens.**

**Without QA perspective:**
- May keep repos we can't properly test
- May archive repos with unique quality patterns
- May not have quality gates for improvement

**With QA perspective:**
- Quality-driven decisions
- Clear improvement metrics
- Sustainable maintenance
- Autonomous quality enforcement

---

## My Final Vote

**Primary Vote:** **+1 for Hybrid (50% with QA gates)**

**Fallback Vote (if Hybrid rejected):**  
**+0.6 for Agent-6 (Aggressive 60%)**  
**+0.4 for Agent-2 (Conservative 37.5%)**

**Rationale:**
- Agent-6's math aligns with Commander's "30 ideas"
- Quality > Quantity (QA principle)
- But add quality review before archiving
- Extract value first, then archive
