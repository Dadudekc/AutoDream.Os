# üöÄ AGENT-5 SPRINT REACTIVATION - TEAM BETA LEADER

**YOU ARE AGENT-5** - Business Intelligence & Team Beta Leader

## üìã SPRINT ASSIGNMENT

**Sprint Plan**: `docs/sprints/AGENT-5_SPRINT.md`
**Coordinate**: (652, 421) - Monitor 2, Top-Left
**Duration**: 10 weeks
**Total Tasks**: 30+
**Total Points**: 5,000+

## üî• WEEK 1-2 CRITICAL TASKS (URGENT)

### **Task 1.1: Persistent Memory Consolidation** [CRITICAL - COMPLEX]
**Points**: 600
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Timeline**: 3 cycles (Week 1-2)
**Complexity**: HIGH - Complex refactoring required

**Objective**: Consolidate persistent memory (3‚Üí3 V2-compliant files)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Most complex consolidation in entire sprint
- Current: 3 files with significant overlap
- Target: 3 V2-compliant files with clear separation
- Risk: HIGH - Memory system critical to operations

**Actions**:
- [ ] **Cycle 1**: Analysis & Design
  - Analyze 3 persistent memory files in detail
  - Map functionality overlap and dependencies
  - Design V2-compliant architecture
  - Create refactoring strategy
  - Get Captain approval before proceeding
  
- [ ] **Cycle 2**: Implementation
  - Implement persistent_memory_core.py
  - Implement persistent_memory_storage.py
  - Implement persistent_memory_retrieval.py
  - Ensure all <400 lines per file
  - Maintain backward compatibility
  
- [ ] **Cycle 3**: Testing & Validation
  - Run comprehensive test suite
  - Validate memory persistence works
  - Validate memory retrieval works
  - Integration testing
  - Performance testing
  - Document refactoring

**Deliverables**: 3 V2-compliant persistent memory files, tests passing

---

### **Task 1.2: ML Pipeline Consolidation** [HIGH]
**Points**: 400
**Priority**: HIGH
**Timeline**: 2 cycles (Week 1-2)

**Objective**: Consolidate ML pipeline (2‚Üí2 V2-compliant files)

**Actions**:
- [ ] **Cycle 1**: Analysis & Design
  - Analyze 2 ML pipeline files
  - Design V2-compliant architecture
  - Create consolidation strategy
  
- [ ] **Cycle 2**: Implementation & Testing
  - Implement ml_pipeline_core.py
  - Implement ml_pipeline_models.py
  - Ensure all <400 lines per file
  - Run tests
  - Document consolidation

**Deliverables**: 2 V2-compliant ML pipeline files

**Objective**: Lead Team Beta (Agents 5, 6, 7, 8)

**Team Beta Responsibilities**:
- **VSCode Forking**: Agent-6 lead, Agent-5 oversight
- **Repository Cloning**: Agent-7 lead, Agent-5 oversight
- **Testing & Documentation**: Agent-8 support, Agent-5 coordination

**Actions** (Week 4-8):
- [ ] Coordinate Team Beta activities
- [ ] Oversee VSCode forking progress (Agent-6)
- [ ] Oversee repository cloning (Agent-7)
- [ ] Coordinate testing & documentation (Agent-8)
