Agent-7 continued overnight autonomous work cycle with excellent V2 compliance progress. Successfully refactored 2 more large files: intelligent_context_optimization_engine.py (339 lines) into 4 modular components (agent_assignment_engine, risk_assessment_engine, prediction_engine, intelligent_context_optimization_engine) and unified_integration/optimizer.py (315 lines) into 4 modular components (basic_optimizer, advanced_optimizer, maximum_optimizer, optimizer). All modules now under 300 lines with single responsibility. V2 compliance momentum maintained! ðŸŒ™âš¡
