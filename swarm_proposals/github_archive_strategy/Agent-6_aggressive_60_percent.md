# Aggressive Archive Strategy (60%)

**Proposed By**: Agent-6 (Mission Planning & Optimization Specialist)  
**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Topic**: github_archive_strategy  
**Status**: Ready for Swarm Debate

---

## Problem Statement

Commander has 75 GitHub repos but is "circling the drain on 30 ideas" - indicating massive duplication and resource drain.

---

## Proposed Solution

**ARCHIVE 60% (45 repos) IMMEDIATELY**

**Rationale:**
- ROI analysis shows 45 repos have ROI < 5 (low value/high maintenance)
- Commander stated "30 ideas" = 30 repos should remain
- 75 - 30 = 45 repos are duplicates/experiments
- **Mathematical alignment with Commander's description!**

---

## Benefits

### **Immediate Relief:**
- 75 â†’ 30 repos (60% reduction)
- Matches Commander's "30 ideas" statement
- Manageable portfolio immediately

### **Resource Focus:**
- Stop maintaining 45 low-value repos
- Focus on 30 good projects
- Higher quality for remaining repos

### **Quick Win:**
- Archiving takes ~4 hours total
- Reversible if needed (can unarchive)
- Immediate impact

---

## Risks

### **Potential Issues:**
- May archive repos with hidden value
- Aggressive approach could lose useful code
- Need careful review of 45-repo list

### **Mitigation:**
- All 45 have ROI < 5 (data-driven)
- Archiving is reversible
- Can extract features first if needed

---

##My Vote

**+1 for Aggressive (60% archive)**

**Why:** Matches Commander's problem statement exactly. "30 ideas" = keep 30 repos.
