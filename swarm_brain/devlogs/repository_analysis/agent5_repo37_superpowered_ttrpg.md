# 📦 Repo #37: Superpowered-TTRPG

**Analyzed By:** Agent-5 | **Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Repo:** https://github.com/Dadudekc/Superpowered-TTRPG

## 🎯 Purpose
Tabletop RPG game system for superpowered characters

**Core:** TTRPG ruleset, character system, game mechanics for superhero-themed tabletop gaming.

## 💡 Utility in Agent_Cellphone_V2
**LOW VALUE - Game System**

**Potential Patterns:**
1. **Character progression** → Agent skill systems (similar to FocusForge!)
2. **Ability/power mechanics** → Agent capability frameworks
3. **Stat tracking** → Performance metrics
4. **Leveling systems** → Agent progression

**BI Assessment:**
- Gamification patterns (but FocusForge is superior)
- Character/progression mechanics
- Rule-based systems

## 🎯 Recommendation
🔴 **ARCHIVE** - ROI: **3/10**

**Rationale:** Gaming project. Gamification patterns already covered by FocusForge (9.5/10). Nice hobby project but low business value.
