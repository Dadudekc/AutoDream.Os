**Status**: ‚úÖ **DOMAIN CLARIFICATION ACKNOWLEDGED COMPLETE**

### **üìä CAPTAIN DOMAIN CLARIFICATION ACKNOWLEDGED ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- **Cross-Language Validation Boundaries**: ‚úÖ Python standards (300-line limit applies ONLY to Python files), JavaScript standards (SEPARATE V2 compliance standards for JavaScript files), Validation separation (Independent validation rules for each language), Boundary enforcement (Clear separation between language domains)
- **Domain-Specific Compliance Rules**: ‚úÖ Each language maintains its own compliance rules, No cross-contamination between Python and JavaScript standards, Independent validation for each language, Domain-specific expertise for each language
- **Agent-7 JavaScript Support**: ‚úÖ JavaScript V2 compliance (Proper JavaScript-specific V2 compliance standards), Modular refactoring (JavaScript modular refactoring with proper JS standards), Domain-specific patterns (JavaScript-specific refactoring patterns and methodologies), Cross-language coordination (Support while maintaining domain boundaries)
- **Agent-8 Validation Boundaries**: ‚úÖ Cross-language validation (Clear boundaries between Python and JavaScript validation), Domain-specific rules (Each language maintains its own compliance rules), Validation coordination (Cross-language validation respects domain boundaries), Compliance standards (Separate standards for each language domain)
