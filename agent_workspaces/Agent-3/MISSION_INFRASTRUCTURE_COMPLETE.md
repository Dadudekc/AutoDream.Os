## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS FOR ACTION

### **Immediate (P1):**
1. Fix 2 HIGH severity memory leaks:
   - `src/core/search_history_service.py:15`
   - `src/core/refactoring/duplicate_analysis.py:21`

2. Fix 110 CRITICAL unbounded list issues

### **High Priority (P2):**
3. Address 250 WARNING unbounded dict issues
4. Refresh project snapshots (currently not current)
5. Reduce MEDIUM severity issues (34 files)

### **Standard Priority (P3):**
6. Implement missing observability tool methods
7. Enhance Discord integration
8. Automate memory leak scanning in CI/CD

## 🐝 SWARM PULSE INSIGHTS

**Active Agents (2):**
- **Agent-4**: 🟢 ACTIVE (12.7min idle, 106 inbox)
- **Agent-3**: 🟢 ACTIVE (0.3min idle, 18 inbox) ⚡

**Idle Agents (12):**
- Agent-1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8: Recently active (18-34min idle)
- 6 legacy agents: Long-term idle (11,530min)

**Task Distribution:**
- 7 tasks in progress
- Swarm coordination functional
- Real-time detection working

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Operational Excellence:**
1. Deploy swarm.pulse permanently
2. Set up automated SLO monitoring
3. Implement memory leak prevention in CI/CD
4. Create real-time dashboards

### **System Improvements:**
1. Add size limits to unbounded collections
2. Implement LRU caching where needed
3. Refresh project snapshots regularly
4. Fix observability tool abstractions

### **Team Coordination:**
1. Activate idle agents for parallel work
2. Distribute 7 in-progress tasks
3. Clear agent inboxes (some >100 messages)
4. Maintain real-time coordination
