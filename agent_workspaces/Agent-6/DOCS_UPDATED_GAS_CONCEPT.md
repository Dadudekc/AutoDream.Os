# 📚 DOCUMENTATION UPDATED - "PROMPTS ARE GAS" CONCEPT
## Agent Education Material Created - Agent-6

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Agent**: Agent-6 (Quality Gates & Coordination)  
**Task**: Update docs so agents understand what "GAS" means  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📋 DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

### **1. AGENTS.md** ✅
**Location**: `AGENTS.md` (lines 164-212)

**Added Section**: 🔥 **UNDERSTANDING "PROMPTS ARE GAS"**

**Content Added**:
- What is "Agent Gas"? (gas metaphor explained)
- Why agents need gas (prompts)
- Gas sources (Captain, A2A, self-prompts, system)
- Self-prompting: The fuel pump
- Team coordination: The turbo
- Captain's role: Chief Fuel Distributor

**Key Concepts Documented**:
```
🚗 Car without gas = Parked, idle
🤖 Agent without prompts = Idle, waiting
⛽ Messages in inbox = Gas in tank
🔥 Executing tasks = Engine running
```

---

### **2. prompts/agents/onboarding.md** ✅
**Location**: `prompts/agents/onboarding.md` (top of file)

**Added Section**: 🔥 **CRITICAL CONCEPT: "PROMPTS ARE GAS"**

**Content Added**:
- Critical concept warning at top of onboarding
- Gas metaphor (car analogy)
- 4 gas sources explained
- Reminder: Without messages, agents stay idle!

**Placement**: **TOP OF FILE** (first thing agents see during onboarding)

---

### **3. docs/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_GUIDE.md** ✅
**Location**: `docs/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_GUIDE.md` (NEW FILE - 300+ lines)

**Comprehensive Guide Created**:

#### **Table of Contents**:
1. **The Gas Metaphor** (car analogy explained)
2. **Gas Sources** (4 fuel types)
3. **How to Use Gas** (5-step activation)
4. **Self-Prompting** (fuel pump mechanism)
5. **Team Coordination** (turbo boost)
6. **Gas Monitoring** (fuel gauge)
7. **Success Patterns** (Agent-6 example)
8. **Best Practices** (for agents & Captain)
9. **Quick Reference** (commands)

#### **Key Features**:
- ✅ Complete gas metaphor breakdown
- ✅ Practical examples with commands
- ✅ Agent-6 "Prompts Are Gas" exercise documented
- ✅ Self-prompting tutorial
- ✅ Team coordination strategies
- ✅ Troubleshooting (low fuel warnings)
- ✅ Quick reference commands
- ✅ Visual tables and comparisons

#### **Example Content**:
```bash
# Self-prompt (fuel pump)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {agent_id} \
  --message "🔥 MISSION: Task description"

# Team coordination (turbo)
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent {other_agent} \
  --message "🎯 COORDINATION: Team task"
```

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

### **Agents Will Now Understand**:

**1. What "Gas" Means** ✅
- Prompts/messages are fuel
- Inbox is the gas tank
- No messages = no execution

**2. Why They Need Gas** ✅
- Activation requires prompts
- Idle without messages
- Momentum needs continuous fuel

**3. Gas Sources** ✅
- Captain prompts (primary)
- Agent-to-agent (coordination)
- Self-prompts (momentum)
- System notifications (status)

**4. How to Self-Prompt** ✅
- Identify tasks
- Message themselves
- Maintain momentum
- Self-sustaining execution

**5. Team Coordination Benefits** ✅
- Swarm multiplier effect
- Shared fuel networks
- Coordination amplifies impact
- Team gas > individual gas
