GENERAL VICTOR - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR PHASE 4 INITIATION: Swarm intelligence system post-consolidation status. Phase 2 consolidation completed successfully (4â†’1 file reductions achieved). Current architecture: Intent-oriented subsystem decomposition with 4 subsystems (DebateEngine, MessageRouter, InterventionManager, LifecycleCoordinator). Focus: Orchestration layer decomposition + lifecycle normalization. Goal: Complete Phase 4 without breaking functionality. Key risks: Orchestrator monolith, agent lifecycle drift, memory fragmentation, test coverage gaps. Request strategic guidance for Phase 4 implementation approach.
