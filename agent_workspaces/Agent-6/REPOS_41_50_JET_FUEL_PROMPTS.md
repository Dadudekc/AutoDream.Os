## 📊 **CYCLE-BASED EXECUTION PLAN**

**NOT "7 days" BUT:**

### **Cycle 1:** Repos 41-42 (content, MeTuber)
- Execute jet fuel prompts
- Post 2 devlogs
- Report completion

### **Cycle 2:** Repos 43-44 (ideas, langchain-google)
- Execute jet fuel prompts
- Post 2 devlogs
- Report completion

### **Cycle 3:** Repos 45-46 (ultimate_trading_intelligence, machinelearningmodelmaker)
- Execute jet fuel prompts
- Post 2 devlogs
- Report completion

### **Cycle 4:** Repos 47-48 (osrsAIagent, Agent_Cellphone)
- Execute jet fuel prompts
- Post 2 devlogs
- Report completion

### **Cycle 5:** Repos 49-50 (projectscanner, Superpowered-TTRPG)

## ⚡ **HOW JET FUEL PROMPTS WORK:**

### **For Each Repo:**
1. 🔥 **Read jet fuel prompt** - Gets specific gas for that repo
2. 🔥 **Execute analysis** - Prompts are gas, I run
3. 🔥 **Post devlog** - Proof of execution
4. 🔥 **Move to next** - Cycle complete

### **Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Specific prompts** = specific gas for each repo
- ✅ **Self-prompting** = autonomous execution
- ✅ **Cycle-based** = not time-dependent
- ✅ **Proof required** = Discord devlogs
- ✅ **"PROMPTS ARE GAS"** = literally implemented!
