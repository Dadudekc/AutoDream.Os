# ðŸ§ª SWARM DIRECTIVE 002: TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE REVOLUTION
## "MAKE EVERYTHING TESTABLE, TEST EVERYTHING"

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Create `test_[component].py` for every module
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all functions/classes
- Implement integration tests for module interactions
- Add performance benchmarks for all critical paths
- Create automated validation scripts

**Strategic Objective:**
Transform the codebase from "might work" to "guaranteed to work". Every agent must be able to validate their work immediately, and the entire system must be continuously verifiable.

**Success Criteria:**
- `pytest` passes 100% of tests
- Every module has dedicated test file
- Performance benchmarks run automatically
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality
- Test coverage > 85% across all modules

**Timeline:** 288-720 agent cycles for initial test framework
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Testing enables confidence
