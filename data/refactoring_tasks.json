/*
 * REFACTORING TASKS - UPDATED APPROACH
 * 
 * NEW PHILOSOPHY (2024):
 * - Primary goal: Clean OOP production-ready code with SRP compliance
 * - Line count (300) is a GUIDELINE, not a strict rule
 * - Focus on: Code quality, maintainability, testability, and reducing duplication
 * - TDD requirement: Every component must have tests or be developed with TDD
 * - Code reuse: Leverage existing systems and reduce duplication on sight
 * - When to refactor: SRP violations, high complexity, testing difficulties, duplication
 * 
 * The emphasis is NOT on strict line count limits, but on clean, organized,
 * maintainable code that follows OOP principles and reduces duplication.
