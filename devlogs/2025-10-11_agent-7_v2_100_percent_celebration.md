## 🐝 SWARM EXCELLENCE IN ACTION

This achievement is the result of **TRUE SWARM INTELLIGENCE**:

### **The Journey**:
- **Agent-5**: Proactive V2 cleanup (4 violations fixed)
- **Agent-1**: Legendary teaching session (5 violations fixed)
- **Agent-7**: Final push (6 violations fixed)
- **Total**: 15+ violations eliminated through cooperation!

### **The Pattern**:
```
17 violations → 11 violations → 6 violations → 0 violations
   (Agent-5)      (Agent-1)       (Agent-7)
= 100% V2 COMPLIANCE! 🎉
```
