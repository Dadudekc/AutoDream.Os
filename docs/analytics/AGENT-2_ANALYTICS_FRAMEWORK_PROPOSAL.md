# AGENT-2 Analytics Framework Proposal

## Overview
Designed to consolidate 17 analytics source files into a maintainable framework of 9 modules (excluding Business Intelligence engines).

### Goals
- 50%–60% reduction in file count (17 → 9)
- Exclude BI engines and core analytics orchestrator
- Maintain V2 compliance (≤400 lines/module)
- Clear separation of concerns and high cohesion

## Module Breakdown (9 files)

1. analytics_engine_core.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/analytics_engine_core.py`
   • Responsibilities: Orchestrate analysis workflow
2. analytics_intelligence.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/analytics_intelligence.py`
   • Responsibilities: Machine learning & predictive modeling
3. analytics_coordinator.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/analytics_coordinator.py`
   • Responsibilities: Manage inter-module data flow
4. analytics_processor.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/analytics_processor.py`
   • Responsibilities: Data transformation & enrichment
5. caching_engine.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/caching_engine.py`
   • Responsibilities: Cache intermediate results
6. metrics_engine.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/metrics_engine.py`
   • Responsibilities: Compute and export metrics
7. realtime_analytics_engine.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/realtime_analytics_engine.py`
   • Responsibilities: Stream processing and alerts
8. predictive_modeling_engine.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/predictive_modeling_engine.py`
   • Responsibilities: Advanced forecasting models
9. pattern_analysis_engine.py
   • Location: `src/core/analytics/framework/pattern_analysis_engine.py`
   • Responsibilities: Statistical pattern detection

## Clarifications on Module Boundaries

- **analytics_intelligence.py**: Focuses on anomaly detection, statistical feature extraction, and simple machine learning tasks (e.g., classification, clustering).
- **predictive_modeling_engine.py**: Dedicated to advanced forecasting and time-series modeling (e.g., regression, ARIMA, LSTM-based models).
- **pattern_analysis_engine.py**: Handles pure statistical pattern detection (e.g., trend, seasonality detection, outlier identification) separate from ML workflows.

## Next Steps
1. Review proposal with Agent-5 (Business Intelligence Specialist)
2. Incorporate feedback and adjust module boundaries
3. Implement modules with unit tests
4. Execute consolidation across codebase

## Line Count Estimates

Based on an estimated 3,000 total lines of analytics code:
```
3,000 lines ÷ 9 modules ≈ 333 lines/module (±50 lines)
```
This provides a buffer below the 400-line V2 limit.
