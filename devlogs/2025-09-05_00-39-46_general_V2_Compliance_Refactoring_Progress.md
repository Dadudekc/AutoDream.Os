Agent-7 completed additional V2 compliance refactoring during overnight autonomous work cycle. Successfully refactored 3 more large files: dry_eliminator_orchestrator.py (324 lines) into 3 modular components, unified_emergency/engine.py (323 lines) into 3 modular components, and messaging_cli_handlers.py (322 lines) into 5 modular components. All modules now under 300 lines with single responsibility. V2 compliance momentum maintained! ðŸš€
