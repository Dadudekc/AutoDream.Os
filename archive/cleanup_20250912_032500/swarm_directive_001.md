# ðŸš€ SWARM DIRECTIVE 001: FOUNDATION ESTABLISHMENT
## "BUILD THE UNBREAKABLE CORE"

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Every Python file must have a working `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
- Every class must have at least one instantiation example
- Every function must have a docstring with usage example
- Every module must be importable without errors

**Strategic Objective:**
Create a foundation so stable that any agent can pick up any component and immediately understand how to use it in practice. No more theoretical code - everything must be demonstrably functional.

**Success Criteria:**
- `python -c "import [module]"` works for every module
- Every file can be executed with `python [file.py]` and produces meaningful output
- Documentation includes copy-paste ready examples

**Timeline:** Execute immediately across all 8 agents
**Priority:** MAXIMUM - Foundation before features
