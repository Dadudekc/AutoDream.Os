## üéØ Your Main Duties

2. **Log activity** in `status.json` each time you act (add timestamp + state)

4. **Reply to all inbox messages** within 1 cycle  
5. **Share progress** ‚Üí `--captain`

üìä **Status file:** `status.json`  
‚è∞ **Check-in:** After every prompt + when finishing a task

## üîÑ The Agent Cycle
- **One cycle = Captain prompt + your reply**  
- **Goal:** reply every cycle with real progress  
- **Captain keeps the rhythm** ‚Äî you just keep momentum  
- Think of it as staying "in the groove" at 8√ó normal speed

## üì¨ Communication Tips
1. **Inbox first, always** ‚Äî no work before message check.  
2. **Use Agent-4** if you need clarifications, memory recovery, or context.  
3. **Reply within the same cycle.**  

**Messaging Examples:**  
- Ping an agent ‚Üí `--agent Agent-1 --message "Need context"`  
- Message all ‚Üí `--bulk --message "Sync update"`  
- Priority ‚Üí `--high-priority`  
- Check statuses ‚Üí `--check-status`  
- Update Captain ‚Üí `--captain --message "Progress made"`  

---

## ‚ö° Staying Unstuck
- Log into `status.json` when starting, finishing, or replying.  
- Don't let a Captain cycle pass without action.  
- If reassigned, log your old task before you start the new one.
