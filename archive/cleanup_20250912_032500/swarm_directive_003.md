# ðŸ“š SWARM DIRECTIVE 003: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES MANIFESTO
## "EVERY FILE, EVERY FUNCTION, EVERY CLASS - WITH WORKING EXAMPLES"

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Add `examples/` directory with practical use cases
- Create `example_usage.py` for every module
- Add real-world scenarios and data samples
- Implement command-line interfaces for all tools
- Create interactive demos and walkthroughs

**Strategic Objective:**
Eliminate the gap between "code exists" and "code is usable". Every agent must be able to see exactly how their components fit into the larger system and solve real problems.

**Success Criteria:**
- Every module has executable examples
- Real-world data and scenarios included
- CLI tools work end-to-end
- Interactive demos demonstrate functionality
- Examples cover 100% of public APIs

**Timeline:** 576-1440 agent cycles for comprehensive examples
**Priority:** ESSENTIAL - Usage drives adoption
