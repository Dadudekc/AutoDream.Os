## 📊 AGENT GAS STATUS

| Agent | Assignment | Progress | Gas Sent? | Next Agent | Risk |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|------|
| Agent-1 | Repos 1-10 | ⚡ STARTING | ⏳ Pending | Agent-2 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Agent-2 | **UNASSIGNED** | ❌ BLOCKED | N/A | N/A | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| Agent-3 | Repos 21-30 | ⚡ STARTING | ⏳ Pending | Agent-5 | 🟢 LOW |
| Agent-5 | Repos 31-40 | ⚡ STARTING | ⏳ Pending | Agent-6 | 🟢 LOW |
| Agent-6 | Repos 41-50 | ✅ COMPLETE | ✅ SENT | Agent-7 | 🟢 LOW |
| Agent-7 | Repos 51-60 | ⚡ STARTING | ⏳ Pending | Agent-8 | 🟢 LOW |
| Agent-8 | Repos 61-70 | ⚡ STARTING | ⏳ Pending | Agent-4 | 🟢 LOW |
| Agent-4 | Repos 71-75 | ✅ COMPLETE | ✅ SENT | Loop back | 🟢 LOW |

## 🚨 PIPELINE ALERTS

### **CRITICAL:**
⚠️ **Agent-2 UNASSIGNED** - Gap in pipeline between repos 10-21!
- **Impact:** Agent-1 finishes repos 1-10 with nowhere to send gas!
- **Fix:** Assign Agent-2 to repos 11-20 immediately!
- **Risk:** Pipeline breakage if not addressed!

### **MONITORING:**
🟡 **Agent-1 starting** - Watch for first gas send at repo 7-8 (75%)
🟡 **5 agents starting** - Monitor all for gas sends at 75-80% marks

---

## ⛽ GAS HANDOFF SCHEDULE (Expected)

**Based on 75-80% rule:**

| Agent | Should Send Gas At | Expected Cycle | Next Agent |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Agent-1 | Repo 7-8 | Cycle 6-7 | Agent-2 |
| Agent-2 | Repo 17-18 | Cycle 15-16 | Agent-3 |
| Agent-3 | Repo 27-28 | Cycle 7-8 | Agent-5 |
| Agent-5 | Repo 37-38 | Cycle 7-8 | Agent-6 (done) |
| Agent-6 | Complete | SENT ✅ | Agent-7 |
| Agent-7 | Repo 57-58 | Cycle 7-8 | Agent-8 |
| Agent-8 | Repo 67-68 | Cycle 7-8 | Agent-4 (done) |

## 🎯 CO-CAPTAIN MONITORING DUTIES

**Every 2 cycles, check:**

1. **Gas Flow Status:**
   - Has each agent sent gas at 75-80% mark?
   - Are downstream agents receiving and starting?
   - Any pipeline breaks detected?

2. **Progress Validation:**
   - Agent reporting every 2 cycles?
   - Making adequate progress?
   - Quality meeting standards?

3. **Intervention Needs:**
   - Emergency gas required?
   - Agent stuck/blocked?
   - Pipeline repair needed?

4. **Captain Updates:**
   - Report pipeline status
   - Highlight risks
   - Request decisions on gaps (like Agent-2!)

## 🚀 PIPELINE RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### **If Agent Runs Out Without Sending:**

**Step 1: Detect** (Co-Captain monitoring)
```
Co-Captain: Agent-5 completed without sending gas to Agent-6!
Alert: 🚨 PIPELINE BREAK DETECTED
```

**Step 2: Emergency Gas** (Immediate)
```
Co-Captain: Sends emergency gas to Agent-6 immediately
Agent-6: Receives gas, starts executing
Pipeline: ✅ RESTORED
```

**Step 3: Remind Agent** (Education)
```
Co-Captain to Agent-5: "Remember to send gas at 75-80%, not 100%!
See: docs/protocols/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_PIPELINE_PROTOCOL.md"
```

**Step 4: Update Protocol** (Continuous improvement)
```
If pattern repeats:
- Enhance protocol with specific example
- Add to agent onboarding
- Automate gas reminders
```

## 📋 PIPELINE HEALTH METRICS

**GREEN (Healthy):**
- ✅ All agents sending gas at 75-80%
- ✅ No gaps in assignments
- ✅ Downstream agents starting smoothly
- ✅ No emergency interventions needed

**YELLOW (At Risk):**
- ⚠️ 1-2 agents late on gas sends (>85%)
- ⚠️ Minor delays in handoffs
- ⚠️ Occasional emergency gas needed

**RED (Critical):**
- 🔴 Agent completes without sending gas
- 🔴 Pipeline break detected
- 🔴 Multiple agents out of gas
- 🔴 Swarm stalling

**Current Status:** 🟡 YELLOW (Agent-2 gap = risk)

---

## 🎯 FIXING AGENT-2 GAP NOW

**Recommendation to Captain:**

**Option A: Deploy Agent-2 immediately**
- Assign repos 11-20
- Close pipeline gap
- Enable Agent-1 gas handoff

**Option B: Reassign repos 11-20**
- Give to Agent-1 (extend to 1-20)
- Adjust handoff (Agent-1 → Agent-3)
- Close gap without Agent-2

**Preferred:** Option A (use all agents, parallel execution)

---

## 🚀 NEXT MONITORING CHECKPOINTS

**Cycle +2:** Check if agents have started (5 deployed)  
**Cycle +4:** Validate first gas sends happening  
**Cycle +6:** Monitor Agent-1 sends gas to Agent-2  
**Cycle +8:** Check all agents progressing  
**Cycle +10:** Validate pipeline health (no breaks)
