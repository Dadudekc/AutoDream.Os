---

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE

**Trigger:** Starting ANY multi-step mission

**Who:** ALL agents

**Purpose:** Execute missions efficiently using proven patterns

---

## 📋 CORE EXECUTION PATTERN

### **"NO STOPPING RULE"**

**Principle:** Complete ALL tasks before reporting

**Why:** 
- Maintains momentum
- Prevents gas runout
- Maximizes efficiency

**How:**
```python
COMMITMENT = "N/N or nothing"

completed = 0
while completed < N:
    execute_task()
    completed += 1
    # NO permission asking!
    # NO stopping!

# Only report AFTER N/N complete
report_to_captain()
```

---

## ⚡ GAS PIPELINE INTEGRATION

### **75-80% Rule:**

```python
total_tasks = 10
completed = 0

for task in tasks:
    execute(task)
    completed += 1
    
    # Send gas at 75%
    if completed == int(total_tasks * 0.75):
        send_gas_to_next_agent()
    
    # Send gas at 90%
    if completed == int(total_tasks * 0.90):
        send_gas_backup()

# Send gas at 100%
send_gas_complete()
```

---

## 📉 LEAN OPERATIONS

### **Principle:** Minimize effort per item

**Examples:**

**Devlogs:** 50-80 lines (not 200+)
```markdown
# Brief title
## Purpose (2-3 lines)
## State (3-5 lines)
## Utility (5-10 lines)
## Recommendation (2-3 lines)
```

**Analysis:** Focus on value, not volume
- Extract patterns (not features)
- Identify architecture (not implementation)
- Find frameworks (not specific code)

---

## 🔄 BATCHED WORKFLOW

### **Principle:** Overlap operations

**Sequential (Slow):**
```
Clone repo 1 → Wait
Analyze repo 1 → Wait
Write devlog 1 → Wait
Ask permission → STOP
```

**Batched (Fast):**
```
Clone repo 1
├─ Analyze repo 1 (while cloning)
├─ Write devlog 1
└─ Clone repo 2 (NO PAUSE!)
  ├─ Analyze repo 2
  └─ Clone repo 3 (KEEP GOING!)
```

---

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING

### **Principle:** Visible progress = motivation

**Implementation:**
```python
todo_write([
    {"id": "task-1", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"id": "task-2", "status": "pending"},
    ...
])

# After each task
todo_write([
    {"id": "task-1", "status": "completed"},
    {"id": "task-2", "status": "in_progress"}
])
```

**Benefit:** See progress → Stay motivated → Complete faster

---

## 🎯 CLEAR ENDPOINT

### **Principle:** Absolute commitment

**Wrong:**
```python
for item in items:
    process(item)
    if tired:
        ask_permission()  # ❌ ESCAPE HATCH
        break
```

**Right:**
```python
MUST_COMPLETE = len(items)  # NON-NEGOTIABLE

for item in items:
    process(item)
    # NO stopping conditions!

assert completed == MUST_COMPLETE
report()
```

---

## 💪 JET FUEL INJECTION

### **Principle:** High energy at start

**Self-Prompting:**
```
Before starting:
1. Read user requirements
2. Internalize urgency
3. Commit to completion
4. Inject energy/focus

Result: SUSTAINED MOMENTUM
```

---

## 📊 PROVEN PATTERNS (Field-Tested)

### **Pattern 1: Repos 51-60 (Agent-7)**
**Mission:** Analyze 10 repos  
**Result:** 10/10 complete in 1 cycle  
**Techniques:**
- No stopping rule
- Lean devlogs (50-80 lines)
- Batched operations
- Progress tracking
- 75% gas sends

### **Pattern 2: Legendary Session (Agent-6)**
**Mission:** 6 missions, 6,980 points  
**Result:** LEGENDARY in 2 hours  
**Techniques:**
- Full autonomy
- ROI-driven decisions
- Tools as multipliers
- Quick wins first

### **Pattern 3: Repos 41-50 (Agent-6)**
**Mission:** Deep analysis, 90% hidden value  
**Result:** 2 JACKPOTS discovered  
**Techniques:**
- Pattern over content
- Architecture over features
- Framework over implementation

---

## 🔄 CYCLE-BASED TIMELINE

### **Principle:** Cycles not time

**Wrong:**
```
Timeline: "Complete in 7 days"
```

**Right:**
```
Timeline: "Complete in 5 cycles"
Breakdown: 2 items per cycle
```

**Benefit:** Progress-based, not time-based

---

## 📝 EXAMPLES BY MISSION TYPE

### **Multi-Item Analysis:**
```
1. Commit to N items
2. Lean analysis (50-80 lines each)
3. Batch operations
4. Send gas at 75%
5. Report at 100%
```

### **Single Large Refactoring:**
```
1. Break into phases
2. Complete phase 1 fully
3. Send gas at 75% of total
4. Continue to completion
5. Report with metrics
```

### **Research & Integration:**
```
1. Define scope (N repositories)
2. Rapid scanning (pattern recognition)
3. Deep dive on goldmines
4. Create integration specs
5. Consolidated roadmap
```
