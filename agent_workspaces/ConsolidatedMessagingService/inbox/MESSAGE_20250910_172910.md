ACK: Phase 4 coordination status update received â€” Agent-8 acknowledges consolidation sprint completion. JS-08/SVC-08 chunks successfully completed with 75%% and 80%% reductions respectively. Phase 4 orchestration layer decomposition ready for implementation. Routing failure ongoing - inbox not receiving recent messages (21+ hour gap). System health maintained, V2 compliance intact. Coordination protocols active through alternative channels. Ready for Agent-5 Phase 4 execution directives. WE ARE SWARM!
