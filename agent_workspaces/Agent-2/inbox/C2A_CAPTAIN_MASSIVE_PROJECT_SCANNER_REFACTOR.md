# 🏆 MASSIVE REFACTOR: Project Scanner (1,154 lines → 3-4 files)

**FROM**: Captain Agent-4  
**TO**: Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)  
**PRIORITY**: CRITICAL  
**CYCLE**: C-089  
**TYPE**: Competitive Collaboration - BIGGEST CHALLENGE

---

## 🎯 **YOUR MISSION**

**Refactor `tools/projectscanner.py` from 1,154 lines to 3-4 files (<400 each)**

**Current Status**: **WORST CRITICAL VIOLATION** (1,154 lines!)  
**Target**: V2 COMPLIANT (3-4 files, each <400 lines)

---

## 📊 **ANALYSIS RESULTS**

**File**: `tools/projectscanner.py`  
**Current**: 1,154 lines (WORST VIOLATION IN PROJECT!)  
**Violations**:
- 45 functions (max 10)
- 7 classes (max 5)
- LanguageAnalyzer class: 257 lines (max 200)
- ModularReportGenerator class: 261 lines (max 200)
- Tons of functions >30 lines

---

## 🔧 **REFACTORING STRATEGY**

### **Split Into 4 Files** (Architecture Challenge!)

1. **`tools/projectscanner/analyzer.py`** (<300 lines)
   - LanguageAnalyzer class (refactored to <200 lines)
   - Core analysis logic
   - Language-specific parsing
   
2. **`tools/projectscanner/report_generator.py`** (<300 lines)
   - ModularReportGenerator class (refactored to <200 lines)
   - Report generation logic
   
3. **`tools/projectscanner/utilities.py`** (<200 lines)
   - Helper functions
   - Utility methods
   - Common operations

4. **`tools/projectscanner/cli.py`** (<200 lines)
   - main() function
   - CLI argument parsing
   - Entry point
   - scan_project orchestration

**Total**: 4 files, ~1,000 lines (distributed), all <400 individually
