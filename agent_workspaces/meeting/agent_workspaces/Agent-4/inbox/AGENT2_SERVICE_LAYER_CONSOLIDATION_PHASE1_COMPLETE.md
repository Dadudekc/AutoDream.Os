## 🔍 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Consolidation Strategy Used**
- **Prefix Naming System**: Files with conflicts renamed with descriptive prefixes
  - `messaging_*` for messaging services
  - `dashboard_*` for dashboard services  
  - `orchestration_*` for orchestration services
  - `meeting_*` for meeting workspace services

### **File Movement Examples**
- `src/services/messaging/coordinate_manager.py` → `src/services/messaging_coordinate_manager.py`
- `src/services/dashboard/config_manager.py` → `src/services/config_manager.py` (no conflict)
- `src/services/orchestration/execution_stage.py` → `src/services/execution_stage.py` (no conflict)

### **Directory Structure After Consolidation**
```
src/services/
├── messaging_* (consolidated messaging services)
├── dashboard_* (consolidated dashboard services)
├── orchestration_* (consolidated orchestration services)
├── meeting_* (consolidated meeting workspace services)
├── [existing services remain unchanged]
└── consolidated/ (consolidation documentation)
```
