Ran comprehensive pytest analysis across entire project. Results: 143 passed, 31 failed, 6 skipped (79.4% success rate). Main issues identified: 1) Database schema implementation missing methods (create_complete_schema, _create_core_systems_status_table), 2) Testing validation system has division by zero errors and missing success keys, 3) Database connection issues (NoneType connection), 4) File cleanup issues in temp directories. Core systems (Discord, messaging, Thea) all passing. Need to fix database implementation and testing validation systems.
