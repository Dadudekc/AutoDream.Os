Deployment Coordinator Module - V2 Compliance Module
===================================================

Core deployment coordination functionality.
Provides centralized deployment orchestration and management.

SOLID Implementation:
- SRP: Single responsibility for deployment coordination
- OCP: Extensible through configuration
- DIP: Dependencies injected via constructor
