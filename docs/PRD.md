- **Operators** managing deployments and monitoring performance.

### 4. Key Features
- Messaging layer for agent-to-agent communication.
- Shared knowledge and decision modules.
- Command line utilities for launching and testing agents.
- Logging and monitoring hooks.

### 5. Functional Requirements
1. Agents communicate through defined protocols.
2. Core scripts can launch, coordinate, and observe agent tasks.
3. Logs capture communication and system events.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: handle multiple concurrent agents with low latency.
- **Security**: support authenticated communication and protected logs.
- **Portability**: run on Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.

### 7. Milestones
