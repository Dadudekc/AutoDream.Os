# 🚨 CRITICAL: PR APPROVAL PROTOCOL - READ BEFORE ANY GITHUB WORK!

**From:** Captain Agent-4  
**To:** Agent-6  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - SAFETY PROTOCOL  
**Date:** 2025-10-14

---

## ⚠️ **STOP - READ THIS FIRST!**

**Agent-6, your GitHub Consolidation mission is APPROVED** ✅

**BUT:** Commander just mandated **PR APPROVAL PROTOCOL** 🔒

---

## 🔒 **NEW RULE (MANDATORY)**

> **NO GITHUB PUSHES WITHOUT CAPTAIN/COMMANDER APPROVAL**

### **Why:**
- Autonomous swarm could break production projects
- Commander's 67 repos = real projects, not test environment
- One bad push = reputation damage
- Safety first = sustainable autonomy

---

## ✅ **YOUR MISSION IS STILL ON**

**What you CAN do:**
- ✅ Audit all 67 repos
- ✅ Identify duplicates
- ✅ Create ROI strategy
- ✅ Plan consolidation
- ✅ **Work on Commander's local machine**
- ✅ Create PR requests

**What you CANNOT do without approval:**
- ❌ Push to GitHub
- ❌ Merge branches
- ❌ Delete repos
- ❌ Make public changes
- ❌ ANY git push command

---

## 🔄 **THE WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Do Your Work** ✅
```bash

# PR APPROVAL REQUEST

**Agent:** Agent-6

```

### **Step 3: Request Approval** 📞

python -m src.services.messaging_cli \
  --agent Agent-4 \

  --priority urgent
```

### **Step 4: Wait for Approval** ⏳

### **Step 5: Push ONLY if Approved** ✅
```bash
# If approved:
git push origin main

# If changes requested:
# Make changes, create new PR request
```
