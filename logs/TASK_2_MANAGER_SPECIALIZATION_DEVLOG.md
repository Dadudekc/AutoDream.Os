- **Fixed:** All import conflicts across modules

### Module Boundary Correction
- **Learning Module:** Learning systems only (UnifiedLearningEngine, LearningManager)
- **Decision Module:** Decision systems (DecisionManager, DecisionTypes)
- **Validation Module:** Validation systems (ValidationManager, specialized validators)
- **Managers Module:** General managers (communication, config, status, etc.)

## üìä COMPLIANCE STATUS

### V2 Standards Compliance
- ‚úÖ **OOP Design:** All managers inherit from BaseManager
- ‚úÖ **Proper Inheritance:** Clear hierarchy and specialization
- ‚úÖ **No Strict LOC Limits:** Following new V2 standards
- ‚úÖ **Single Responsibility:** Each manager has focused purpose
- ‚úÖ **No Duplicates:** All duplicate implementations eliminated

### Architecture Compliance
- ‚úÖ **Module Boundaries:** Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Import Structure:** Proper module imports
- ‚úÖ **Base Manager Usage:** Consistent inheritance pattern
- ‚úÖ **Specialization:** Advanced capabilities added

## üîÑ REMAINING WORK

### Pending Manager Specializations
1. **Health Manager** - Health monitoring and alerting
2. **Communication Manager** - Inter-agent communication
3. **Data Manager** - Data handling and storage
4. **Task Manager** - Task coordination and execution

### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Test specialized managers with unified learning engine
