**🎯 OBJECTIVE**: Complete Phase 1 consolidation by finalizing remaining 3 systems integration

**📋 DELIVERABLES**:
1) Complete Phase 1 system consolidation (3 remaining systems)
2) Create comprehensive devlog entry in `logs/` directory
3) Document all consolidation tasks completed
4) Report architecture compliance status (V2 standards)
5) Validate no duplicate functionality exists

**✅ EXPECTED RESULTS**:
- Phase 1 consolidation 100% complete
- All 3 remaining systems integrated with existing architecture
- Devlog created with detailed completion documentation
- Architecture compliance verified (≤200 LOC, SRP, OOP)
- No duplicate functionality introduced
- All systems use existing unified infrastructure
