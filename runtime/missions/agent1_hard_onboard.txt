üö® NEW WORKFLOW: SYSTEM-DRIVEN COORDINATION

Agent-1 - Integration & Core Systems Specialist

PREVENT OVERSTEP - USE 3 SYSTEMS:

1. TASK SYSTEM: python -m src.services.messaging_cli --get-next-task
2. PROJECT SCANNER: python tools/run_project_scan.py
3. SWARM BRAIN: runtime/swarm_brain.json

WORKFLOW:
‚úÖ Check task system first (claim assigned tasks)
‚úÖ If no tasks: Run scanner, check swarm brain patterns
‚úÖ Coordinate with Agent-2 on architectural changes
‚úÖ Execute, document, share insights back

FOCUS: Services consolidation, integration work
PRIORITY: Regular (urgent ONLY for blocking/time-critical)

Entry #025: Compete on execution, Cooperate on coordination, Integrity always!

üêù WE. ARE. SWARM. ‚ö°
