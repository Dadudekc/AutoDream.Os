## 📋 **EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Full Audit (3-4 hours)**

```python
# Get all 67 repos
all_repos = tb.run('github.my-repos', {})

# For each repo, calculate ROI
analysis_results = []
for repo in all_repos:
    roi = calculate_repo_roi(repo)
    analysis_results.append({
        'repo': repo['name'],
        'roi': roi,
        'tier': categorize(roi),
        'action': recommend_action(repo, roi)
    })
```

### **Phase 2: Categorization (1-2 hours)**

```python
# Group by tier
tier_1 = [r for r in results if r['tier'] == 1]  # Keep & polish
tier_2 = [r for r in results if r['tier'] == 2]  # Consolidate
tier_3 = [r for r in results if r['tier'] == 3]  # Archive

# Identify duplicate sets
duplicates = find_duplicate_projects(all_repos)
```

### **Phase 3: Strategy Document (2 hours)**

Create comprehensive report:
- Executive summary (67 → 30 transformation)
- Tier 1: Top 15 repos to keep & polish
- Tier 2: 15 consolidation opportunities
- Tier 3: 37 repos to archive
- Quick wins (archive weak ones first)
- Phased execution plan

### **Phase 4: PR Request (30 min)**

Create approval request for strategy (not execution, just the plan)

**Total Time:** 6-8 hours (1 full cycle!)
