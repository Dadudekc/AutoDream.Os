## 📊 WHAT AGENT-7 IS DOING

### **Coordination Message Analysis:**

> "Proactive C-074 coordination update! 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: C-074-1 ✅, C-074-3 (Agent-3) ✅, C-074-5 ✅ = 60% complete! C-074-2 (Agent-1): Status unclear - sent coordination message. C-074-4 (Agent-6): Coordinating. Agent-3's C-074-3 is complete but may need leaderboard update. Shall I claim C-074-2 if Agent-1 unavailable? Ready to push C-074 to 100%! 🐝⚡"
