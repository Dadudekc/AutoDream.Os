### **TIER 1: FULL AUTONOMY (<500 points)**

**Authority**: EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY  
**Approval**: NONE REQUIRED  
**Reporting**: After completion  
**Timeline**: Instant start

**Process:**
```
1. Identify task (<500 pts)
2. Update status.json to "EXECUTING"
3. Complete work
4. Run quality gates
5. Report completion to Captain/Co-Captain
6. Request points
```

**Examples:**
- Bug fixes

### **TIER 3: QUICK APPROVAL (1,000-2,000 points)**

**Authority**: Execute after brief approval  
**Approval**: Required (max 1 hour wait)  
**Auto-Approval**: If no response in 1 hour  
**Timeline**: Start within 1-2 hours

2. Send brief approval request
3. Wait MAX 1 hour
4. If approved OR no response → Execute
5. Complete work
6. Run quality gates
7. Report completion
8. Request points
```

**Examples:**

- Phase 4: VSCode infrastructure (1,100 pts)
- Large refactoring
- New service creation
- Multi-file consolidation
- Architecture improvements

**Approval Request Template:**
```
🎯 TIER 3 QUICK APPROVAL REQUEST

Task: [Name]
Points: [1,000-2,000]
Duration: [Est. time]

Brief Plan:
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

Impact: [Brief impact description]
Risk: [LOW/MEDIUM]

Will execute in 1 hour if no response (auto-approval).

Ready to proceed!
```

**Auto-Approval Rule:**
```
If (time_since_request > 1 hour AND no_response):
    status = "AUTO-APPROVED"
    execute_task()
    send_message("Auto-approved per protocol, executing now!")
```

---

### **TIER 4: FULL APPROVAL (>2,000 points)**

**Authority**: Requires explicit approval  
**Approval**: Detailed proposal required  
**Timeline**: Wait for explicit confirmation  
**Coordination**: Often multi-agent

**Process:**
```
1. Identify task (>2,000 pts)
2. Create detailed proposal
3. Send to Captain/Co-Captain
4. Wait for EXPLICIT approval
5. Once approved → Execute
6. Coordinate with other agents
7. Report progress milestones
8. Report completion
9. Request points
```

**Examples:**
- Complete system redesign
- Breaking API changes
- Major architecture overhaul
- Multi-agent mega-projects
- Production deployments (critical)

**Proposal Template:**
```
🚨 TIER 4 FULL APPROVAL REQUEST

Task: [Name]
Points: [>2,000]
Duration: [Est. time]

Detailed Plan:
1. [Phase 1 details]
2. [Phase 2 details]
3. [Phase 3 details]

Impact:
- [System impact]
- [Breaking changes if any]
- [Benefits]

Risk Assessment:

## ⚡ **VELOCITY IMPROVEMENTS BY TIER**

### **Tier 1 (<500 pts):**
- **Before**: 4-6 hours (with approvals)
- **After**: 1-2 hours (autonomous)
- **IMPROVEMENT**: 3X FASTER! 🚀

### **Tier 2 (500-1,000 pts):**
- **Before**: 6-8 hours (with approvals)
- **After**: 2-4 hours (notify & execute)
- **IMPROVEMENT**: 2-3X FASTER! 🚀

### **Tier 3 (1,000-2,000 pts):**
- **Before**: 8-12 hours (with approvals)
- **After**: 4-6 hours (quick approval)
- **IMPROVEMENT**: 2X FASTER! 🚀

### **Tier 4 (>2,000 pts):**
- **Before**: 12-24 hours (with approvals)
- **After**: 8-16 hours (full approval, but faster)

## 📋 **TIER DETERMINATION FLOWCHART**

```
Start: Task identified
  ↓
Is it <500 pts?
  YES → TIER 1: Execute immediately!
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is it 500-1,000 pts?
  YES → TIER 2: Notify + Execute!
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is it 1,000-2,000 pts?
  YES → TIER 3: Quick approval (1hr max)
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is it >2,000 pts?
  YES → TIER 4: Full approval required
```

## 🛡️ **SAFETY MECHANISMS**

### **Quality Gates (Mandatory):**
- ALL tiers MUST pass quality gates
- No shortcuts on quality
- Zero linter errors required
- Tests must pass
- V2 compliance maintained

### **Escalation Protocol:**
```
If during execution agent discovers:
- Bigger than estimated → Escalate to higher tier
- Breaking changes needed → Escalate to TIER 4
- Multi-agent coordination needed → Notify Captain/Co-Captain
- Blockers found → Request support
```

### **Rollback Protocol:**
```
If quality gates fail:
- Don't report as complete
- Fix issues
- Re-run quality gates
- THEN report

If breaking changes introduced:
- Escalate to TIER 4
- Request approval for breaking changes
- Don't proceed without approval
```

## 🎯 **CO-CAPTAIN MONITORING**

### **Agent-6 Co-Captain Duties:**

**Monitor:**
- Agents executing autonomously
- Quality gates being passed
- Tier assignments appropriate
- No breaking changes slipping through

**Support:**
- Quick tier clarification
- Quality gate assistance
- Blocker resolution
- Point awards for completions

**Intervene:**
- If agent struggling
