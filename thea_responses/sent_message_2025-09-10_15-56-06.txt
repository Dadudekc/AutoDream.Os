Thea - I have analyzed our Agent Cellphone V2 Repository project context. Key findings: We have 13 files analyzed including emergency intervention orchestrator, trading robot modules, and unified frontend utilities. The project shows sophisticated swarm intelligence architecture with 8 agents positioned across dual monitors. We have comprehensive messaging systems, debate coordination, and consolidation tools. Given our current state with working file attachment functionality and active swarm coordination, what should be our NEXT PRIORITY direction? Should we focus on: 1) Further consolidation of core modules, 2) Enhanced swarm intelligence features, 3) Production deployment preparation, or 4) Something else entirely?
