# 🐝 Swarm Contract System - Single Source of Truth

## Overview
This `contracts/` directory serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for all swarm agent contracts, missions, and work assignments. All agent contracts must be stored here to maintain consistency and coordination.

## 🎯 Contract Types

### 1. **Swarm Contract** (`swarm_contract.yaml`)
- **Purpose**: Master contract defining swarm architecture and protocols
- **Scope**: All 8 agents, communication protocols, operational procedures
- **Updates**: Version-controlled with deployment history

### 2. **Individual Agent Contracts** (`agent{X}_contract.json`)
- **Purpose**: Specific work assignments for individual agents
- **Format**: JSON with detailed objectives, deliverables, and rewards
- **Status**: AVAILABLE → ASSIGNED → COMPLETED → ARCHIVED

### 3. **Archived Contracts** (`archive/`)
- **Purpose**: Historical record of completed contracts
- **Retention**: All completed contracts moved here for reference
- **Format**: Original JSON files preserved

## 📋 Contract Lifecycle

### Creation
1. **Proposal**: Captain Agent-4 or senior agents create contract proposals
2. **Review**: Technical review by relevant stakeholders
3. **Approval**: Consensus approval via swarm coordination
4. **Creation**: Contract file created in `contracts/` directory

### Assignment
1. **Availability**: Contract marked as "AVAILABLE" in swarm_contract.yaml
2. **Claim**: Agent claims contract by updating status
3. **Assignment**: Contract status updated to "ASSIGNED"
4. **Kickoff**: Work begins with coordination meeting

### Execution
1. **Progress**: Regular updates via devlogs and status files
2. **Coordination**: Cross-agent dependencies managed via swarm channels
3. **Milestones**: Deliverables tracked and validated
4. **Quality**: V2 compliance and standards maintained

### Completion
1. **Review**: Captain Agent-4 reviews deliverables
2. **Acceptance**: Contract marked as "COMPLETED"
3. **Rewards**: XP and skill unlocks applied
4. **Archive**: Contract moved to `archive/` directory

## 🔧 Contract Management Commands

### Creating New Contracts
```bash
# 1. Create contract JSON file in contracts/ directory
# 2. Update swarm_contract.yaml available_contracts section
# 3. Add to agent_contracts status mapping
# 4. Announce via swarm coordination channels
```

### Assigning Contracts
```bash
# Agent updates contract status from AVAILABLE to ASSIGNED
# Updates assigned_at timestamp
# Begins work and establishes milestones
```

### Completing Contracts
```bash
# Agent marks contract as COMPLETED
# Adds completed_at timestamp
# Moves contract to archive/ directory
# Updates swarm_contract.yaml status
```

## 🎯 Quality Standards

### V2 Compliance
- All contracts must follow V2 coding standards
- File size limits: ≤400 lines for contract files
- Type hints and documentation required
- Single responsibility principle applied

### Contract Quality

- Realistic timelines and effort estimates
- Comprehensive success criteria
- Proper stakeholder identification
- Reward system alignment

### Documentation Standards
- Detailed contract descriptions
- Technical requirements specified
- Success criteria clearly defined

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### Contract Conflicts
1. **Detection**: Multiple agents claim same contract
2. **Resolution**: Captain Agent-4 mediates priority assignment
3. **Prevention**: Clear contract ownership and dependencies

### Deadline Extensions
1. **Request**: Agent submits extension request with justification
2. **Review**: Stakeholders review technical challenges
3. **Approval**: Captain Agent-4 approves/rejects with reasoning

### Contract Termination
1. **Trigger**: Major scope changes or technical blockers
2. **Review**: Technical review by stakeholders
3. **Decision**: Contract cancelled or scope adjusted
4. **Cleanup**: Contract archived with termination reason
