# 🎖️ CAPTAIN-SPECIFIC STALL PREVENTION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**
**Date**: 2024-08-19
**Purpose**: Address user's specific requirements for Captain-5 stall prevention
**Scope**: Captain-5 specific monitoring using cursor response detection

---

## 🎯 **USER REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED**

### **Primary Request**:
> "no im saying just for the captain so u specifically dont go black for 5minutes or more we need a prompt to be sent to the captain letting them know they are captain and to assign contracts and prompt agents to work on a timer so if it recieves an additional message it will que if they are dark it will light them back up to work i thought we had cursor response detection and could use that to see when agents have stopped but idk if we can query the database for all 5 instances of cursor we have opened at once"

### **Requirements Breakdown**:
1. ✅ **Captain-specific system** - Only monitors Captain-5, not all agents
2. ✅ **5-minute dark time prevention** - Prevents Captain-5 from going dark for 5+ minutes
3. ✅ **Captain duty prompts** - Reminds Captain-5 of captaincy responsibilities
4. ✅ **Contract assignment prompts** - Ensures contracts are assigned
5. ✅ **Agent work prompts** - Prompts agents to work on contracts
6. ✅ **Message queuing** - Queues additional messages if captain is active
7. ✅ **Agent lighting** - Lights up agents if captain goes dark
8. ✅ **Cursor response detection** - Monitors all 5 cursor instances simultaneously
9. ✅ **Database querying** - Queries database for all 5 cursor instances at once

- **Real-time monitoring** - Updates every 30 seconds
- **All 5 instances tracked** - Agent-1, Agent-2, Agent-3, Agent-4, Captain-5
- **Status tracking** - Active, responding, stalled

### **4. Duty Prompt System**:
- **Normal duty reminder** - Every 5 minutes when captain active
- **Urgent duty reminder** - Every 3 minutes when captain inactive
- **Critical duty reminder** - Every 1 minute when captain going dark

### **5. Agent Activation System**:
- **Automatic activation** - When Captain-5 goes dark for 5+ minutes

## ⏰ **SYSTEM OPERATION FLOW**

### **Normal Operation (Captain-5 Active)**:
```
Every 5 minutes → Check Captain-5 activity → Send normal duty prompt → Continue monitoring
```

### **Warning Mode (Captain-5 Inactive 3+ minutes)**:
```
Every 3 minutes → Send urgent duty prompt → Monitor for response → Escalate if needed
```

### **Emergency Mode (Captain-5 Dark 5+ minutes)**:
```
Every 1 minute → Send critical duty prompt → Activate all agents → Continue monitoring
```

### **Cursor Monitoring (Continuous)**:
```
Every 30 seconds → Check all 5 cursor instances → Update status → Detect stalls
```

## 🎖️ **CAPTAIN DUTY PROMPTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **Normal Duty Prompt (Every 5 minutes)**:
```
🎖️ CAPTAIN-5 DUTY REMINDER - You are the active Captain!

Your responsibilities:
1. Monitor agent progress
2. Assign new contracts
3. Coordinate team efforts
4. Lead toward 50-contract goal

Please acknowledge and continue leading!
```

### **Urgent Duty Prompt (Every 3 minutes when inactive)**:
```
🚨 CAPTAIN-5 URGENT DUTY REMINDER - You have been inactive!

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Check agent status
2. Assign pending contracts
3. Coordinate team efforts
4. Resume leadership duties

CAPTAIN-5 - Please respond NOW!
```

### **Critical Duty Prompt (Every 1 minute when going dark)**:
```
🚨🚨 CAPTAIN-5 CRITICAL DUTY REMINDER - You are going DARK!

CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:
1. IMMEDIATELY check all agents
2. Assign ALL pending contracts
3. Activate stalled agents
4. Resume captaincy NOW

CAPTAIN-5 - EMERGENCY RESPONSE REQUIRED!
```

## 🖱️ **CURSOR RESPONSE DETECTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Database Structure**:
```json
{
  "Agent-1": {
    "last_response": "2024-08-19T13:20:00.000000",
    "response_count": 0,
    "status": "active",
    "last_activity": "2024-08-19T13:20:00.000000",
    "cursor_coordinates": {"x": -1317, "y": 487}
  },
  "Agent-2": { ... },
  "Agent-3": { ... },
  "Agent-4": { ... },
  "Captain-5": { ... }
}
```

### **Monitoring Capabilities**:
- ✅ **All 5 instances tracked** simultaneously
- ✅ **30-second update frequency** for real-time monitoring
- ✅ **Status classification** (active/responding/stalled)
- ✅ **Coordinate tracking** for each agent instance
- ✅ **Response count and activity logging**

---

## 🚀 **AGENT ACTIVATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**

### **When Activation Triggers**:
- **Captain-5 dark** for 5+ minutes
- **Critical duty prompts** sent without response
- **System detects** captain leadership gap

### **Activation Message**:
```
🚨 CAPTAIN-5 DARK STATUS DETECTED - AGENT ACTIVATION REQUIRED!

AGENT STALL PREVENTION SERVICE:
Captain-5 has been inactive for [X] minutes.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. All agents must acknowledge this activation message
2. Resume current contract work IMMEDIATELY
3. Report current status and progress
4. Confirm back online and working

CAPTAIN-5 - Please respond and resume captaincy duties!

AUTOMATIC AGENT ACTIVATION SYSTEM - EMERGENCY MODE
```

## 🎯 **KEY DIFFERENCES FROM GENERAL STALL PREVENTION**

### **This System (Captain-Specific)**:
- ✅ **Focuses ONLY on Captain-5** - prevents captain dark time
- ✅ **Uses cursor response detection** - monitors all 5 instances
- ✅ **Sends duty prompts** - reminds captain of responsibilities
- ✅ **Activates agents** - when captain goes dark
- ✅ **5-minute timer** - specific to captain activity

### **General Stall Prevention System**:
- ✅ **Monitors all agents** - prevents general Code Black events
- ✅ **Uses captain status checks** - monitors captain responsiveness
- ✅ **Sends status checks** - verifies captain activity
- ✅ **Initiates recovery** - when system stalls detected
- ✅ **10-minute timer** - general system health monitoring

### **Both Systems Work Together**:
- **Captain-Specific**: Prevents Captain-5 from going dark
- **General**: Prevents overall system stalls
- **Complementary**: Address different aspects of system reliability
