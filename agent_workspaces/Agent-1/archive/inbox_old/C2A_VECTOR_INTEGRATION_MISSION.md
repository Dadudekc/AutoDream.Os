## 📋 MISSION OVERVIEW

**Task**: Consolidate Vector Integration Services (4 files → 1)  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Points**: 1,200  
**Timeline**: 3-4 cycles  
**V2 Compliance**: Required (<400 lines final result)

## 🎯 YOUR SURVEY FINDINGS (Sept 9)

From your comprehensive services survey, you identified:

**High Priority Consolidation**:
- Vector Integration Consolidation (4 files → 1)
- Target file reduction: 60%
- Expected impact: 70% maintenance improvement
- V2 compliance rate: 100%

**Your expertise** mapped these files and their consolidation strategy!

## 📂 TARGET FILES

### Files to Consolidate:
1. `src/services/agent_vector_cli.py`
2. `src/services/agent_vector_utils.py`
3. `src/services/vector_integration_service.py`
4. Related vector service files in src/services/

### Expected Result:
- **1 unified file**: `src/services/unified_vector_service.py` (<400 lines)
- Clean API surface
- Backward compatibility maintained
- All imports working

## 🔧 EXECUTION APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Analysis** (Cycle 1)
1. Review current vector service files
2. Map dependencies and imports
3. Identify core functionality vs utilities
4. Plan consolidation architecture

### **Phase 2: Consolidation** (Cycle 2)
1. Create `unified_vector_service.py`
2. Merge core functionality
3. Apply SOLID principles
4. Maintain V2 compliance (<400 lines)

### **Phase 3: Migration** (Cycle 3)
1. Update all imports to new unified service
2. Add backward compatibility shims if needed
3. Test all vector operations
4. Verify zero breaking changes

### **Phase 4: Cleanup** (Cycle 4)
1. Remove old files (after verification)
2. Update documentation
3. Run comprehensive tests
4. Create completion report
