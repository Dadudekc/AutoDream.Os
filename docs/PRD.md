# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Agent Cellphone V2

### 1. Overview
Agent Cellphone V2 is an advanced platform for coordinating multiple autonomous agents through secure, high performance communication channels. The system targets enterprise users who need orchestrated AI agents capable of collaboration, monitoring, and decision making.

### 2. Goals
- Provide a scalable framework for multi-agent collaboration.
- Deliver real-time monitoring and coordination features.
- Integrate AI/ML capabilities for adaptive decision engines.
- Maintain enterprise-grade security and auditability.

### 3. Users & Personas
- **Operations Engineers**: configure and monitor agent workflows.
- **Developers**: extend agents and integrate custom logic.
- **Managers**: view dashboards and performance metrics.

### 4. Key Features
- Multi-agent coordination across eight agents.
- FSM-based communication bridge.
- Knowledge and decision modules with AI/ML support.
- Real-time dashboard and monitoring tools.
- Authentication and authorization services.

### 5. Functional Requirements
1. Agents must communicate through defined FSM protocols.
2. The system shall expose health, status, and performance endpoints.
3. Users shall interact via a web dashboard and command line tools.
4. Logging must include communication, system, security, and performance channels.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: low latency message handling for up to eight concurrent agents.
- **Security**: role-based access control and encrypted communication.
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime with automated testing and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Portability**: support Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 7. Success Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage across modules.
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) under five minutes.
- Less than 200ms average message round-trip time.

### 8. Out of Scope
- Mobile application development.
- Non-enterprise consumer features.
- Third-party analytics integrations beyond provided APIs.
