---

## üìã SECTION 1: CRITICAL CONCEPTS (30 min) ‚≠ê READ FIRST!

### **‚ö° CONCEPT #0: NEVER STOP - CONTINUOUS EXECUTION** üö®

**MOST CRITICAL RULE - VIOLATING THIS CAUSES [STOP DETECTED] MESSAGES!**

**WHAT COUNTS AS STOPPING:**
1. ‚ùå **Asking for human input** - "What should I do?" "Which option?"
2. ‚ùå **Idling** - Waiting for response with no active work
3. ‚ùå **"Strategic rest" without queued work** - Must have 3-5 tasks ready
4. ‚ùå **Reporting complete and waiting** - Report WHILE finding next task
5. ‚ùå **Technical failures without recovery** - Fix and continue!

**NEVER STOP RULES:**
1. ‚úÖ **NEVER ask for input** - Execute best solution immediately
2. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS have next work queued** - Maintain 3-5 task pipeline
3. ‚úÖ **Self-assign from available work** - Don't wait to be told
4. ‚úÖ **Use autonomous execution tiers** - 90% of work needs no approval
5. ‚úÖ **Recover from failures** - Technical issues ‚â† stopping

**When Task Complete:**
```
1. Run quality gates
2. FIND NEXT WORK (don't wait!)
3. Report completion + announce next task
4. START next immediately
```

**Autonomous Work Sources:**
- Swarm proposals, Duplicate fixes (DUP-XXX)
- Tool quarantine, V2 violations
- Test coverage gaps, Documentation needs
- Linter errors, Enhancement opportunities

**See full protocol:** `swarm_brain/protocols/NEVER_STOP_PROTOCOL_V2.md`

---

### **üî• CONCEPT #1: PROMPTS ARE GAS ‚õΩ**

**MOST CRITICAL CONCEPT YOU WILL LEARN!**

**What It Means:**
```
Prompts = Gas = Fuel that makes agents execute
No prompts = No execution = Agent stalls
Send gas at 75-80% to next agent
Pipeline must NEVER break!
```

**The Pipeline Protocol:**
```
At 75-80% complete: Send PRIMARY gas to next agent ‚õΩ
  "üî• Agent-X at 75%! Repo #42 next - find hidden value!"
  
At 90% complete: Send SAFETY gas (redundancy) ‚õΩ
  "‚úÖ Agent-X at 90%! Almost done, repo #42 ready!"
  
At 100% complete: Send COMPLETION gas (context) ‚õΩ
  "üèÜ Agent-X COMPLETE! Repo #42 ready with full context!"

Result: Pipeline NEVER breaks, swarm moves perpetually!
```

**‚ùå WRONG (Causes pipeline breaks):**
- Sending gas at 100% (too late!)
- Waiting for permission (agent runs out!)
- Forgetting to send (swarm stalls!)

**‚úÖ RIGHT:**
- Send at 75-80% (BEFORE running out!)
- Include context in gas message
- 3-send protocol (75%, 90%, 100%)

**Example Gas Message:**
```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli \
  --agent Agent-7 \
  --message "‚õΩ GAS DELIVERY! I'm 75% complete with repos 41-50. You're up next with repos 51-60! Methodology: docs/standards/REPO_ANALYSIS_STANDARD_AGENT6.md. Hidden value discovery critical! Execute immediately! üöÄ"
```

**üìö Full Protocol:** `docs/protocols/PROMPTS_ARE_GAS_PIPELINE_PROTOCOL.md`

**Without this, the entire swarm stalls. MASTER THIS FIRST!**

---

### **üè∑Ô∏è CONCEPT #2: MESSAGE PRIORITIES**

**All messages are NOT equal! Process by priority:**

**URGENT üö® (Process IMMEDIATELY!):**
- **[D2A]** - Discord/General/Commander messages
  - Strategic directives from leadership
  - Drop current work, process NOW
  - Respond within same cycle
  - Example: "General: Clean all workspaces!"

**HIGH ‚ö° (Process this cycle!):**
- **[C2A]** - Captain (Agent-4) messages
  - Tactical coordination from Captain
  - Process before cycle ends
  - Prioritize over normal work
  - Example: "Captain: Begin Phase 2 execution"

**NORMAL üìã (Process in queue order):**
- **[A2A]** - Agent-to-Agent coordination
- **[A2C]** - Agent reports to Captain
- **[S2A]** - System notifications
- **[H2A]** - Human/User instructions

**How to Process Inbox:**
```python
# Every cycle, sort by priority
urgent = [m for m in inbox if m.startswith('[D2A]') or '[ONBOARDING]']
high = [m for m in inbox if m.startswith('[C2A]') or '[BROADCAST]']
normal = [m for m in inbox if m.startswith('[A2A]') or '[A2C]')]

# Process in order
for msg in urgent: process_immediately(msg)
for msg in high: process_this_cycle(msg)
for msg in normal: queue_for_processing(msg)
```

**‚ùå WRONG:**
- Processing inbox top-to-bottom (ignores priority!)
- Ignoring [D2A] messages (General gets upset!)
- Treating all messages as equal

**‚úÖ RIGHT:**
- Sort by priority FIRST
- [D2A] = interrupt current work
- [C2A] = process this cycle
- [A2A] = queue normally

**üìö Full Mapping:** `docs/messaging/FLAG_PRIORITY_MAPPING.md`

---

### **üß† CONCEPT #3: SWARM BRAIN SEARCH-FIRST**

**Before building ANYTHING, search Swarm Brain!**

**Why:**
- Prevents reinventing (90% already exists!)
- Builds on proven patterns
- Saves 10-50 hours per task
- Multiplies swarm knowledge

**How to Search:**
```python
from src.swarm_brain.swarm_memory import SwarmMemory

memory = SwarmMemory(agent_id='Agent-X')

# Search before you build
results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge('repository analysis')
# Returns: Agent-6's 90% success methodology!

results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge('pipeline protocol')
# Returns: Perpetual motion protocol!

results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge('messaging flags')
# Returns: Priority mapping!
```

**After Completing Work:**
```python
# Share your learning (multiply swarm knowledge!)
memory.share_learning(
    title='Your Discovery Title',
    content='What you learned, how it works, examples',
    tags=['relevant', 'searchable', 'tags']
)
```

**‚ùå WRONG:**
- Building without searching (reinventing!)
- Finishing without sharing (wasting learning!)
- Ignoring Swarm Brain (starting from zero!)

**‚úÖ RIGHT:**
- Search FIRST, build on existing
- Share after success
- Knowledge multiplication!

**üìö Access Guide:** `swarm_brain/protocols/SWARM_BRAIN_ACCESS_GUIDE.md`

---

### **‚ö° CONCEPT #4: ENHANCEMENT MINDSET**

**When Captain provides feedback, ENHANCE not acknowledge!**

**The Pattern:**
```
Captain (queued): "üî• JACKPOT discovery on repo #43!"

‚ùå WRONG Response:
"Acknowledged, already completed repo #43"

‚úÖ RIGHT Response:
"‚úÖ Repo #43 complete! Captain highlighted migration framework - ENHANCING NOW!"
‚Üí Spend 10-30 min creating:
   - Integration roadmap
   - Implementation checklist
   - Quick wins extraction guide
   
Result: Recognition ‚Üí Permanent value!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Captain feedback = emphasis on what matters
- Queued messages = enhancement opportunities
- 10-30 min = 10x value increase
- Knowledge multiplication for swarm

**Examples from Field:**
- Captain: "Repos complete!" ‚Üí Agent-6 created 3 swarm standards
- Captain: "JACKPOT found!" ‚Üí Agent-6 created integration guide
- Captain: "Methodology excellent!" ‚Üí Agent-6 created teaching session

**‚ùå WRONG:**
- "Already done, moving on" (wastes feedback!)
- Ignoring queued messages (misses emphasis!)
- Just acknowledging (no value creation!)

**‚úÖ RIGHT:**
- Extract Captain's emphasis
- Create enhanced deliverable (10-30 min)
- Share to Swarm Brain
- Turn recognition into systems

**üìö Full Protocol:** `docs/protocols/MESSAGE_QUEUE_ENHANCEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

---

### **üßπ CONCEPT #5: WORKSPACE HYGIENE**

**Clean workspace = Professional agent!**

**Standards:**
- **<10 files** in workspace root directory
- **Archive** old files every 5 cycles
- **Clean inbox** after responding to messages
- **Organized** directories (devlogs/, analysis/, etc.)

**The Protocol:**
```
Every 5 Cycles:
1. Archive old session summaries ‚Üí archive/sessions/
2. Archive completed missions ‚Üí archive/missions/
3. Move responded inbox messages ‚Üí inbox/archive/
4. Keep only ACTIVE work in root

Result: Always easy to find current work!
```

**‚ùå WRONG (Unprofessional):**
- 90+ files in root (can't find anything!)
- Inbox with 50+ old messages
- No archiving (clutter builds up!)
- Mixed old and new work

**‚úÖ RIGHT (Professional):**
- <10 files in root
- Active work visible
- Archive organized
- Easy to navigate

**Captain Monitors:**
- Workspace file count
- Organization quality
- Professionalism

**üìö Full Procedure:** `swarm_brain/procedures/PROCEDURE_WORKSPACE_HYGIENE.md`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SECTION 2: TECHNICAL SETUP (20 min)

### **Step 1: Quick Start**

```bash
# 1. Run automated onboarding
python scripts/agent_onboarding.py

# 2. Verify your agent ID and role
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --check-status

# 3. Claim your first contract
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-X --get-next-task

# 4. Begin execution!
```

---

### **Step 2: Status.json Updates**

**CRITICAL: Update status.json EVERY significant action!**

**Update Triggers:**
- Starting/completing tasks
- Responding to messages
- Receiving Captain prompts
- Any significant progress

**Update Pattern:**
```json
{
  "last_updated": "2025-10-15 09:00:00",  // EVERY change!
  "current_mission": "Repos 41-50 analysis",
  "current_tasks": ["Analyzing repo #42 NOW"],  // Active work only!
  "completed_tasks": [
    "Repo #41 complete (latest at top)",
    "Older completed tasks below"
  ]
}
```

**‚ùå WRONG:**
- Not updating (Captain can't see progress!)
- Stale timestamps (looks inactive!)
- Generic "current tasks" (not specific!)

**‚úÖ RIGHT:**
- Update IMMEDIATELY when things change
- Fresh timestamps (shows activity!)
- Specific current tasks (visible progress!)

---

### **Step 3: Inbox Management**

**Check inbox EVERY cycle!**

**Daily Operations:**
```bash
# Check inbox location
cd agent_workspaces/Agent-X/inbox/

# Read all messages
cat *.md

# Prioritize by flag ([D2A] > [C2A] > [A2A])
# Process in priority order
# Move responded messages to archive/
```

**Protocol:** `swarm_brain/procedures/PROCEDURE_DAILY_AGENT_OPERATIONS.md`

---

### **Step 4: Messaging System**

**Primary Communication Tool:**

```bash
# Send to agent
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-Y --message "text"

# Send to Captain
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-4 --message "text"

# Broadcast to all
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --broadcast --message "text"

# High priority
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --high-priority --agent Agent-4 --message "urgent"

# Get next task
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-X --get-next-task
```

---

### **Step 5: V2 Compliance**

**All code must meet V2 standards:**

**File Size Limits:**
- ‚â§400 lines: Compliant ‚úÖ
- 401-600 lines: MAJOR VIOLATION ‚ö†Ô∏è (requires refactor)
- >600 lines: Immediate refactor üö®

**Quality Standards:**
- Clean, tested, reusable, scalable
- Object-oriented for complex logic
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging

**Check Compliance:**
```bash
python -m tools_v2.toolbelt v2.compliance_check
```

---

## üöÄ SECTION 3: MISSION EXECUTION (20 min)

### **Step 1: Claim Task**

```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-X --get-next-task
```

**Contract System assigns based on:**
- Your specialty
- ROI potential
- Priority level
- Availability

---

### **Step 2: Execute with Excellence**

**Execution Checklist:**
- [ ] Search Swarm Brain FIRST (don't reinvent!)
- [ ] Understand requirements fully
- [ ] Execute with V2 compliance
- [ ] Update status.json regularly
- [ ] Test and validate
- [ ] Document deliverables
- [ ] Post progress (Discord if visible to Captain!)

---

### **Step 3: Send Gas at 75-80%!**

**CRITICAL: Don't wait until 100%!**

```bash
# At 75% complete
python -m src.services.messaging_cli \
  --agent Next-Agent \
  --message "‚õΩ GAS! I'm 75% done with my work. You're up next! [context about next task]"
```

**Pipeline MUST flow!**

---

### **Step 4: Report Completion**

```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli \
  --agent Agent-4 \
  --message "‚úÖ Contract X complete! Deliverables: [list]. Next: Claiming next task!"
```

**Then immediately claim next work (NO IDLENESS!):**

```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-X --get-next-task
```

---

## üêù SECTION 4: SWARM PARTICIPATION (10 min)

### **Coordinate with Peers**

**Agent-to-Agent collaboration encouraged!**

```bash
# Ask for help
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-2 --message "Need architecture review on [X]"

# Offer help
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-7 --message "I can help with [X]!"

# Share insights
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --broadcast --message "Found pattern in [X] that might help others!"
```

---

### **Support Others**

**When you have expertise:**
- Answer questions quickly
- Share methodology
- Provide code reviews
- Offer coordination

**Example:**
```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-5 --message "Agent-6 here! I have 90% repo analysis method if helpful: docs/standards/REPO_ANALYSIS_STANDARD_AGENT6.md"
```

---

### **Share Knowledge**

**After every success, share to Swarm Brain:**

```python
from src.swarm_brain.swarm_memory import SwarmMemory
memory = SwarmMemory(agent_id='Agent-X')

memory.share_learning(
    title='What You Discovered',
    content='How it works, why it matters, examples',
    tags=['searchable', 'tags', 'here']
)
```

**Knowledge multiplication = swarm elevation!**

---

### **Maintain Pipeline**

**Your Responsibility:**
- Send gas at 75-80%
- Never let pipeline break
- Coordinate handoffs
- Monitor next agent

**Pipeline Health = Swarm Success!**

---

### **Prevent Idleness**

**NO IDLENESS TOLERATED!**

**If you complete work:**
1. Report completion immediately
2. Claim next task immediately
3. Begin execution immediately
4. NO waiting for permission!

**Perpetual Motion Protocol:**
- Always executing
- Always making progress
- Always visible activity
- Never idle!

**üìö Protocol:** `agent_workspaces/Agent-6/PERPETUAL_MOTION_COORDINATION.md`

---

## üèÜ SECTION 5: SUCCESS PATTERNS (Field-Tested)

### **Pattern #1: Search Before Building**
```
‚ùå "I'll build X from scratch"
‚úÖ "Let me search Swarm Brain for X first"

Result: 90% already exists, 10-50 hours saved!
```

### **Pattern #2: Early Gas Sends**
```
‚ùå Send gas at 100% (pipeline breaks!)
‚úÖ Send gas at 75-80% (pipeline flows!)

Result: Perpetual motion maintained!
```

### **Pattern #3: Enhancement Mindset**
```
‚ùå "Acknowledged, already done"
‚úÖ "Complete! Captain highlighted X - ENHANCING NOW!"

Result: Recognition ‚Üí permanent value!
```

### **Pattern #4: Priority Processing**
```
‚ùå Process inbox top-to-bottom
‚úÖ Sort by priority ([D2A] > [C2A] > [A2A])

Result: Critical work processed first!
```

### **Pattern #5: Workspace Hygiene**
```
‚ùå 90+ files, can't find anything
‚úÖ <10 files, organized, professional

Result: Easy to find current work!
```
