## 🚨 PRELIMINARY FINDINGS (NEW)

### Finding 4: Agent-3 Workspace Anomaly (MEDIUM) ⚠️
**Issue**: Agent-3 marked as INACTIVE but has extensive workspace with Python modules
- Contains caching system, migration tools, scalability components
- Status shows INACTIVE in unified_config
- Workspace suggests recent active development

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Resource allocation confusion
**Recommended**: Clarify Agent-3 status or clean workspace

### Finding 5: Agent Workspace Naming Inconsistency (LOW) ⚠️
**Issue**: Mixed naming conventions
- Agent-1, Agent-2, Agent-3, Agent-4, Agent-7, Agent-8: PascalCase
- agent-5, agent-6: lowercase
- Specialty workspaces: descriptive names

**Impact**: LOW - Potential path resolution issues
**Recommended**: Standardize to PascalCase (Agent-X)

### Finding 6: Database Specialist Workspace (INFO) ℹ️
**Issue**: Database_specialist workspace has 139 files
**Status**: Informational - may be legacy or specialized role
**Recommended**: Investigate purpose and current usage
