## 🎯 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### **Decision 1: Sprint-Based Organization**
- **Rationale**: 190+ tasks in one document is unmanageable
- **Solution**: 8 individual agent sprints with clear ownership
- **Benefit**: Clear accountability, easier tracking, manageable chunks

### **Decision 2: Keep V2 as Master Reference**
- **Rationale**: V2 is comprehensive (190+ tasks vs 14 in V1)
- **Solution**: V2 remains master reference, V1 archived
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for complete scope

### **Decision 3: Captain Tracking Summary as Dashboard**
- **Rationale**: Need centralized coordination and oversight
- **Solution**: Comprehensive tracking dashboard for Captain
- **Benefit**: Real-time visibility, proactive risk management

### **Decision 4: Team Beta Structure**
- **Rationale**: VSCode forking and repo cloning are specialized tasks
- **Solution**: Agent-5 leads Team Beta (Agent-6: VSCode, Agent-7: Repos, Agent-8: Testing)
- **Benefit**: Focused expertise, clear leadership, parallel execution
