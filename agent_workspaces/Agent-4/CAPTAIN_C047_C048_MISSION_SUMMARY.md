## 🎯 STRATEGIC COORDINATION

### Multi-Mission Coordination
**C-074 Mission** (Dream.OS + DreamVault Integration):
```
Phase 1: Agent-7, Agent-1, Agent-3 (parallel) → 1 cycle
Phase 2: Agent-2, Agent-4 (sequential) → 3 cycles
```

**C-048 Mission** (C-047 Follow-up + Integration Testing):
```
Phase 1: Agent-8, Agent-1, Agent-7 (parallel) → 1 cycle
Phase 2: Agent-3 (testing) → 2 cycles
Phase 3: Agent-2 (validation) → 3 cycles
```

### Dependency Management
✅ **Clear Dependencies**: All tasks have explicit dependency chains  
✅ **Parallel Execution**: Maximum 3 agents per phase  
✅ **No Conflicts**: No agent assigned overlapping critical tasks  
✅ **Strategic Sequencing**: Testing follows fixes, validation follows testing

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Process Improvements
1. ✅ **Syntax fixes require runtime testing** - Discovered via C-047
2. ✅ **Import errors cascade across modules** - Managed via C-074
3. ✅ **Parallel execution maximizes efficiency** - Proven in both missions
4. ✅ **Clear dependencies prevent conflicts** - Essential for multi-agent

### Best Practices Established
1. **Immediate Analysis**: Respond to agent reports within 5 minutes
2. **Strategic Orders**: Generate 5 clear, prioritized tasks per mission
3. **Parallel + Sequential**: Balance immediate tasks with follow-up validation
4. **Broadcast Updates**: Keep entire swarm informed of coordination

### Command-Line Escaping
⚠️ **Issue Identified**: Complex messages with quotes require careful escaping  
✅ **Solution**: Use simpler syntax or escape quotes properly  
📝 **Documentation**: Add to CAPTAIN_COMMANDS_CHEAT_SHEET.md
