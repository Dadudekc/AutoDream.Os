   - Specific tasks and deliverables
   - Points and timelines
   - Success criteria
   - Quality gates
   - Notes and best practices

2. **Cycle Timeline**: `docs/CYCLE_TIMELINE.md`
   - Their assigned cycles
   - Expected outcomes per cycle
   - Handoff instructions
   - Anti-loop safeguards

3. **Captain Tracking**: `docs/CAPTAIN_TRACKING_SUMMARY.md`

   - Weekly milestones
   - Quality gates
   - Escalation protocols

4. **Startup Message**: Via PyAutoGUI
   - Critical rules
   - Week 1 critical path
   - Immediate actions
   - Cycle response format

---

## 🚀 WEEK 1 CRITICAL PATH

### Day 1 (Immediate):
- **C-001**: Agent-6 fixes v3_009_nlp_pipeline.py (URGENT-BLOCKING)
- **C-003**: Agent-3 runs Discord bot cleanup script
- **C-005**: Agent-3 analyzes 133 __init__.py files

### Day 2-3:
- **C-008**: Agent-1 analyzes coordinate loader files
- **C-011**: Agent-2 designs messaging system architecture
- **C-022**: Agent-5 starts persistent memory analysis (3-cycle task)

### Checkpoint:
- **C-010**: Agent-4 (Captain) reviews Week 1 Phase 1 progress

---

## 📋 CYCLE EXECUTION RULES

All agents must follow:

### 1. One Cycle = One Deliverable
Every response must produce concrete output (no acknowledgment-only responses).

### 2. Use #DONE-Cxxx Tag
Every cycle must end with this tag to signal completion.

### 3. Clear Handoffs
Specify which agent acts next and what they do.

### 4. Captain at Checkpoints Only
Captain reviews only at C-010, C-025, C-050, C-075, C-100, C-125, C-150, C-160.

### 5. Blocked Protocol
Use #BLOCKED-Cxxx for immediate escalation (don't wait for checkpoint).

---

## 🎯 REQUIRED CYCLE RESPONSE FORMAT

All agents must use this format:

```
CYCLE: C-XXX
OWNER: Agent-X
STATUS: COMPLETE
DELIVERABLE: [Specific file/analysis/test result]
NEXT: Agent-Y will [specific action] in C-XXX+1
#DONE-CXXX
```

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENTS

### What We Prevented:
- ❌ **Acknowledgment loops** - Every cycle must have deliverable
- ❌ **Duplicate work** - Single ownership per cycle
- ❌ **Unclear priorities** - Week 1 critical path defined
- ❌ **Poor coordination** - Handoffs clearly specified
- ❌ **Scope confusion** - Each agent knows their tasks

### What We Enabled:
- ✅ **Efficient execution** - No wasted cycles
- ✅ **Clear ownership** - Every task has an owner
- ✅ **Strategic oversight** - Captain reviews at checkpoints
- ✅ **Immediate escalation** - Blocked protocol defined
- ✅ **Measurable progress** - #DONE tags track completion
