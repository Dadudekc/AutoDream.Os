- Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings
- Testing: Unit and integration tests
- Security: Environment variables only

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
1. Review your V3 contracts in future_tasks.json
2. Claim your first contract (V3-001 recommended)
3. Begin execution with quality gates active
4. Coordinate with Captain (Agent-4) for progress updates

📝 DISCORD DEVLOG REMINDER: Create a Discord devlog for this action in devlogs/ directory
------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 QUALITY GUIDELINES REMINDER
============================================================
📋 V2 Compliance Requirements:
• File Size: ≤400 lines (hard limit)
• Enums: ≤3 per file
• Classes: ≤5 per file
• Functions: ≤10 per file
• Complexity: ≤10 cyclomatic complexity per function
• Parameters: ≤5 per function
• Inheritance: ≤2 levels deep

🚫 Forbidden Patterns (Red Flags):
• Abstract Base Classes (without 2+ implementations)
• Excessive async operations (without concurrency need)
• Complex inheritance chains (>2 levels)
• Event sourcing for simple operations
• Dependency injection for simple objects
• Threading for synchronous operations
• 20+ fields per entity
• 5+ enums per file

✅ Required Patterns (Green Flags):
• Simple data classes with basic fields
• Direct method calls instead of complex event systems
• Synchronous operations for simple tasks
• Basic validation for essential data
• Simple configuration with defaults
• Basic error handling with clear messages

🎯 KISS Principle: Start with the simplest solution that works!
📊 QUALITY GATES: Run `python quality_gates.py` before submitting code!
