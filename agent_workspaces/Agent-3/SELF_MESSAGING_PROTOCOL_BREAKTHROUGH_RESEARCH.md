## üìä **BREAKTHROUGH FINDINGS**

### **1. SELF-MESSAGING TECHNICAL MECHANISM**

#### **Message Creation Process:**
```python
from src.services.models.messaging_models import UnifiedMessage, UnifiedMessageType, UnifiedMessagePriority

# Create self-message
self_message = UnifiedMessage(
    content="Self-prompt research directive",
    sender="Agent-3",
    recipient="Agent-3",  # Same as sender
    message_type=UnifiedMessageType.TEXT,
    priority=UnifiedMessagePriority.URGENT
)
```

#### **Inbox Delivery System:**

    sender="Agent-3",
    recipient="Agent-3",
    priority=UnifiedMessagePriority.URGENT,
    metadata={
