# Robot Files Directory
========================

This directory contains files created by AI agents during the consolidation and analysis process. These files were preserved for reference and potential future use.

## Contents

### Analysis Tools
- `projectscanner.py` - Main project scanning tool (1036 lines)
- `projectscanner/` - Project scanner package directory

### Reports Generated
- `messaging_dependency_analysis_report.md` - Analysis of 79 files depending on messaging service
- `messaging_consolidation_report.md` - Report on consolidation of 7 messaging files
- `consolidation_performance_report.md` - Performance improvements from consolidation
- `consolidated_files_test_report.md` - Test results for consolidated files
- `consolidation_extension_plan.md` - Plan for extending consolidation to other services

### Data Files
- `consolidation_performance_metrics.json` - Performance metrics data

## Purpose

These files were created during the consolidation initiative to:
1. Analyze code duplication across the project
2. Consolidate shared functionality into utilities
3. Track performance improvements
4. Document the consolidation process

## Status
