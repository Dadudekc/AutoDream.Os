# Agent Protocol System Documentation

## Overview

The Agent Protocol System defines the standardized operating procedures, communication protocols, and quality standards for the V2_SWARM multi-agent system. This system ensures consistent behavior, reliable communication, and maintainable code across all agents.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- All configuration and data must have a single authoritative source
- No duplicate or conflicting information across the system
- Centralized configuration management through SSOT Manager

### 2. V2 Compliance Standards
- **File Size**: ‚â§400 lines per file
- **Class Limit**: ‚â§5 classes per file
- **Function Limit**: ‚â§10 functions per file
- **Line Length**: ‚â§100 characters per line
- **No Abstract Classes**: Avoid complex inheritance patterns
- **No Threading**: Use direct calls instead of threading

### 3. General Cycle Protocol
All agents follow a standardized 5-phase cycle:

1. **CHECK_INBOX**: Process messages and role assignments
2. **EVALUATE_TASKS**: Assess available tasks and priorities
3. **EXECUTE_ROLE**: Execute tasks using role-specific protocols
4. **QUALITY_GATES**: Validate V2 compliance and quality standards
5. **CYCLE_DONE**: Report completion and prepare for next cycle

- Use snake_case for database columns and API fields
- Prefer class-based design for complex logic
- Apply repository pattern for data access
- Keep business logic inside service layers
- Use dependency injection for shared utilities
- Avoid circular dependencies across modules

### Testing

### Workflow
- Commit messages must follow convention: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- Pull requests must pass code review and CI checks before merge
- Split large features into smaller, incremental PRs
- All timeline references use agent response cycles (1 cycle = 2-5 minutes)
