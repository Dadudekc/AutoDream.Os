## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Shared `load_simple_config` helper for agent vector integration modules.
- Centralized prediction analytics utility `BasePredictionAnalyzer` for shared
  probability and confidence computations (SSOT).
- Terminal completion monitor to detect completion signals from logs.
- Cursor task repository with env-configurable path and monitor cross-checking.
- SSOT `COMPLETION_SIGNAL` defined in `config/messaging.yml` and exposed via
  `src.core.constants`.
- Managers append `COMPLETION_SIGNAL` to terminal outputs upon task completion.
- Automated project snapshots via pre-commit (generation) and pre-push (enforcement).
- Artifacts: project_analysis.json, test_analysis.json, chatgpt_project_context.json, dependency_cache.json.
- Documented overnight consistency enhancements in
  `docs/specifications/OVERNIGHT_CONSISTENCY_ENHANCEMENTS_PRD.md`.
### Changed
- Consolidated captain documentation into `docs/guides/captain_handbook.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to emphasize Python-first guidelines and exempt the monitoring component from language restrictions.
- Refactored dashboard demo to use Enum-based agent statuses for type safety.
### Removed
- Removed obsolete `urgent_agent_activation.py` and `ai_ml_cli.py` after confirming no in-repo usage.
- Deleted redundant `docs/CAPTAIN_HANDBOOK.md` and `docs/guides/CAPTAIN_AGENT_4_OPERATIONAL_HANDBOOK.md`.

### Notes
- If pre-commit modifies files, commit again to include refreshed snapshots.
