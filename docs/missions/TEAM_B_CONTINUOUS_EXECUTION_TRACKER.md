## ‚õΩ GAS MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

1. **Continuous Assignments:** No agent sits idle
2. **Progress Reports:** Updates every 30min keep momentum
3. **Peer Gas:** Agents message each other encouragement
4. **LEAD Gas:** I send motivational updates regularly
5. **Discord Visibility:** Commander sees activity remotely

**Gas Sources:**
- Urgent assignments (IMMEDIATE fuel)
- Progress milestones (achievement fuel)
- Peer recognition (motivation fuel)
- Commander directives (strategic fuel)
- Mission completion (ultimate fuel)
