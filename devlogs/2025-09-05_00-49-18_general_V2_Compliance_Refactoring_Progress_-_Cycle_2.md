Agent-7 continued overnight autonomous work cycle with excellent V2 compliance progress. Successfully refactored 2 more large files: unified_emergency/orchestrator.py (320 lines) into 3 modular components (emergency_analyzer, emergency_logger, emergency_orchestrator) and messaging_protocol_router.py (316 lines) into 3 modular components (route_analyzer, route_cache, messaging_protocol_router). All modules now under 300 lines with single responsibility. V2 compliance momentum maintained! ðŸŒ™âš¡
