## üéØ **WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION DETAILS**

### **From: 8-Agent Full Swarm Coordination**
**Challenges Identified:**
- Command complexity with 8 simultaneous agents
- Communication overhead and coordination latency
- Captain-Commander authority conflicts
- Resource allocation inefficiencies
- Decision-making bottlenecks

### **To: 4-Agent Core Team Coordination**
**Optimized Structure:**
```
Captain (Agent-4) ‚Üí Commander (Agent-6) ‚Üí Core Team (Agents 1, 8)
Support Team: Agents 2, 3, 5, 7 (On-Demand Activation)
```

**Core Coordination Team:**
- **Agent-1**: Core Systems & Integration (Technical implementation)
- **Agent-4**: Captain - Strategic Oversight (Strategic direction)
- **Agent-6**: Commander - Operational Coordination (Daily operations)
- **Agent-8**: Operations & Support (Process management)

**Support Team (Activated as needed):**
- **Agent-2**: Architecture (Design patterns, system structure)
- **Agent-3**: Infrastructure (DevOps, deployment, scaling)
- **Agent-5**: Business Intelligence (Data analysis, reporting)
- **Agent-7**: Web Development (APIs, frontend/backend)
