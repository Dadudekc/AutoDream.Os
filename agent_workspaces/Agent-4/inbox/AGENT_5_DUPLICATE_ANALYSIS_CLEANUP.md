- `Agent-STM-6/` (old team management)
- `database_specialist/`
- `coordination_specialist/`
- `infrastructure_specialist/`
- `Captain/` (now Agent-4)

**Recommendation:** DELETE ALL (obsolete from old naming system)

---

### **2. Broadcast Message Duplicates (Expected)**

**7 copies of each broadcast:**
- Lean Excellence mission (7x)
- Captain messages (7x)
- Execution orders (7x)

**Why:** Sent to all agents (normal)  
**Status:** Most archived, some in active inboxes  
**Action:** Archive remaining old broadcasts

### **3. Analysis Repo Files (Temporary)**

**553 README.md files** from cloned GitHub repos  
**Location:** `analysis/repos/`
