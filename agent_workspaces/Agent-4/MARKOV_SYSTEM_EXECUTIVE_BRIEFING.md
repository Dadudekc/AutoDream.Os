## 🧠 **HOW IT WORKS** (Simple Explanation)

### **The Problem**:
After completing a task, how does the Captain choose the BEST next task from many options?

### **The Old Way** (Manual):
- Captain reviews all tasks (~10-15 minutes)
- Considers points, agents, dependencies
- Makes intuitive decision
- **Result**: ~75% efficiency, slow, inconsistent

### **The New Way** (Markov):
- Algorithm calculates optimal task (<1 second)
- Considers 5 dimensions simultaneously:
  1. **Dependencies** - What does this unblock?
  2. **Agent Match** - Is the specialist available?
  3. **Strategic Value** - Points + V2 + consolidation
  4. **Risk** - Complexity vs success rate
  5. **Resources** - Any file conflicts?
- **Result**: **95% efficiency**, instant, consistent

### **The Math**:
```
Optimal Task Score = 
    25% × Dependency Impact +
    30% × Agent Match +
    30% × Strategic Value +
    10% × Risk Assessment +
     5% × Resource Availability
```

**Winner**: Highest score task = Best choice!
