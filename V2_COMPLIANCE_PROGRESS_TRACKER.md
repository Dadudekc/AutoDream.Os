## 🎯 REFACTORING APPROACH

### Primary Goal
Clean OOP Production-Ready Code with Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Secondary Goal
Reduce file sizes to improve maintainability and readability

### Emphasis
Code quality, organization, and maintainability over strict line count limits

### Core Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class/module has one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed Principle** - Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
4. **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns and layers
5. **Production Readiness** - Proper error handling, logging, and documentation
