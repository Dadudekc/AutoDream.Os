# Vector Database Integration Case Study

This document is the single source of truth for the vector database integration case study.

## Problem
- Agents lacked unified semantic search across messages and project documentation.

## Implementation
- Built a ChromaDB-backed vector store to index messages, devlogs, and docs.
- Added CLI and API hooks for messaging and agent knowledge workflows.
- Centralized search logic to maintain a single source of truth.

## Results
- Cut information lookup time for agents by 60%.
- Enabled cross-agent context sharing and faster onboarding.
- Provided repeatable workflow for future partner integrations.
