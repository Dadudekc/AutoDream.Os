## ⭐ AGENT-1 CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Chapters 1-10)

**JACKPOT FINDING:** Contradicted Agent-2's audit!

- Repo #1 (network-scanner): 7 test files + full CI/CD pipeline! ✅
- Repo #2 (machinelearningmodelmaker): CI/CD badge + workflows! ✅
- Repo #3 (dreambank): Tests + CI/CD! ✅

**Pattern:** 3/3 cloned repos (100%) have quality infrastructure!

**Impact:** Corrected swarm's understanding with evidence!
