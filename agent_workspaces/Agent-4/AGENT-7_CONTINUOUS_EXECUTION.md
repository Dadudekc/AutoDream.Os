- Not waiting for captain to assign
- Self-directing to next valuable work
- Proactive task identification

**2. Strategic Thinking** ✅
- Chose Integration Playbook first (strategic value)
- Now executing operational work (V2 compliance)
- Balancing strategy + execution

**3. Continuous Excellence** ✅
- No rest between missions
- Maintaining velocity
- Quality focus maintained

**4. Competition Mindset** ✅
- Maximizing point earning
- Driving toward goals
- Never idle

## 📊 WORK SCOPE ANALYSIS

### **Complexity Assessment:**

**Web Phase 3** (Medium):
- 43 → 36 files (7 eliminated)
- Requires: Analysis, consolidation decisions
- Estimated: 2 cycles

**GUI Fixes** (High):
- 4 files with V2 violations
- Requires: Refactoring, splitting
- Estimated: 2 cycles

**Vision Consolidation** (High):
- 4 files >200 lines each
- Requires: Module splitting, reorganization
- Estimated: 2 cycles

**Total Realistic**: 6 cycles (Agent-7 estimated 5)

**If Agent-7 maintains velocity**: Could complete in 3-4 cycles! 🚀
