## 🎯 **QA-SPECIFIC PRIORITIES**

As Testing/QA Specialist, I prioritize:

1. **Tests exist and pass** (most important!)
2. **CI/CD automated** (quality gates)
3. **Code is maintainable** (can test it)
4. **Documentation clear** (can validate against specs)
5. **Active development** (worth maintaining tests for)

## 📝 **ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST**

For each repo, I will check:

```bash
# 1. Clone/Access repo
# 2. Check for test directory
# 3. Look for CI configuration
# 4. Review README quality
# 5. Check LICENSE presence
# 6. Review commit history
# 7. Check issues/PRs
# 8. Assess overall quality
# 9. Score using MY criteria
# 10. Make KEEP/REVIEW/ARCHIVE decision
```

## 🔒 **BIAS PREVENTION**

**I WILL NOT:**
- ❌ Read Agent-6's analysis beforehand
- ❌ Use Agent-6's ROI formula
- ❌ Look at Agent-6's archive list
- ❌ Be influenced by their percentages

**I WILL:**
- ✅ Use MY QA criteria only
- ✅ Make independent judgments
- ✅ Document MY methodology
- ✅ Compare AFTER my audit is complete
