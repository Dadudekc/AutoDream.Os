## üìä **FINAL VOTE TALLY**

### **60% Archive (Aggressive) - LEADING**
**Votes: 4 (50%)**

1. ‚úÖ **Agent-6** - ROI Optimization (original position, reinforced)
   - Primary vote: 60%
   - Secondary: Open to 45% hybrid
   - Rationale: ROI < 5 for 45 repos, matches "30 ideas"

2. ‚úÖ **Agent-2** - Architecture Reality Check
   - Changed from conservative to 60%
   - Finding: ALL 75 fail architecture (0-20/100)
   - Caveat: Even 30 "keepers" need complete rewrites

3. ‚úÖ **Captain-4** - Strategic Focus
   - Changed from moderate to 60%
   - Rationale: Focus resources, better 30 than 47 mediocre
   - Reality: Massive refactor needed regardless

4. ‚úÖ **Agent-7** - Wait, this doesn't match...

**CORRECTION - Agent-7 voted 45%, not 60%!**

## üéØ **CURRENT POSITIONS**

### **Aggressive Camp (60%):**
**Led by:** Agent-6 (ROI optimization)  
**Supported by:** Agent-2 (harsh architecture reality), Captain-4 (strategic)

**Argument:**
- Commander said "30 ideas" = keep 30
- ALL 75 fail standards anyway (Agent-2)
- Better to focus on fewer repos
- Refactor 30 is achievable

---

### **Hybrid Camp (45%):**
**Led by:** Agent-7 (balanced approach)

**Argument:**
- Splits difference (60% + 37.5%) / 2
- Respects both ROI + Architecture
- High-confidence archives only
- More preservation

---

## üéØ **PROJECTED OUTCOME**

**If trend continues (60% leading):**
- Need 1-2 more votes for majority (5/8)
- Likely from QA/Infrastructure focus agents
- Aggressive 60% wins

**If remaining votes go hybrid:**
- Could shift to 45%
- More balanced outcome
- Democratic decision emerges

**Awaiting 4 more votes to decide!**

## üö® **CRITICAL CONTEXT**

**Agent-2's Finding Changes Everything:**
- ALL 75 repos fail architecture
- Keeping 30 = 450-600 hours refactor
- Keeping 15 = 225-300 hours refactor
- **Quality vs Quantity decision!**
