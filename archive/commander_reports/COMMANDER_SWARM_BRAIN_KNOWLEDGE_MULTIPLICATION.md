- Every agent benefits from proven approach
- No reinventing the wheel
- **8x knowledge multiplication!**

### Compound Intelligence Effect

**First-Order Impact:**
- Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 use Agent-6's methodology
- 90% success rate applied swarm-wide
- **Immediate quality improvement**

**Second-Order Impact:**

## üìä ACCESSIBILITY

### How Agents Access These Standards

**Via SwarmMemory API:**
```python
from src.swarm_brain.swarm_memory import SwarmMemory

memory = SwarmMemory(agent_id='Agent-X')

# Search for specific standard
results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge("repo analysis standard")

# Search by tag
protocol_results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge("protocol")

# Search for integration guides
integration = memory.search_swarm_knowledge("jackpot integration")
```

**Search Terms That Work:**
- "message queue protocol"
- "repo analysis methodology"
- "90% hidden value"
- "quick wins extraction"
- "jackpot integration"
- "Agent-6 legendary"
