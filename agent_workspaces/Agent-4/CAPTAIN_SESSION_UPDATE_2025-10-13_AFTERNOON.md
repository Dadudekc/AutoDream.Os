## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Messaging Classification Still Broken**

**Issue:** Messages from agents are still flagged `[C2A]` (Captain-to-Agent) instead of `[A2A]` (Agent-to-Agent).

**Evidence:**
- Agent-6's Day 3 report: Flagged `[C2A]` (should be `[A2A]`)
- Agent-7's completion report: Flagged `[C2A]` (should be `[A2A]`)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Messages FROM agents TO Captain = `[A2A]`
- Messages FROM Captain TO agents = `[C2A]`
- Messages FROM user TO agents = `[H2A]` or `[D2A]`

**Fixes Implemented Earlier (May Need Verification):**
1. `src/services/messaging_cli_handlers.py` - Sender detection logic
2. `src/services/onboarding_template_loader.py` - Full template loading
3. `docs/MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_USAGE_POLICY.md` - Documentation

**Next Action Required:**
- Verify fixes are deployed
- Test sender detection logic
- Confirm message classification working correctly

## 🎯 **NEXT CYCLE PRIORITIES**

1. **Agent-6:** Complete Day 3 (Integration + E2E tests), finish Phase 1
2. **Agent-7:** Strategic rest authorized (legendary session complete)
3. **Agent-2:** Strategic rest authorized (phenomenal config work)
4. **Agent-3:** Strategic rest authorized (Discord Commander complete)
5. **Agent-1:** Status check needed (34 days idle - assign new mission?)
6. **Messaging System:** Verify classification fixes are working
