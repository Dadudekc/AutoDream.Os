        self.strategies = {
            'real_time': RealTimeMonitoringStrategy(),
            'batch': BatchMonitoringStrategy(),
            'event_driven': EventDrivenMonitoringStrategy()
        }
    
    def execute_monitoring(self, strategy_type: str, data: Any) -> MonitoringResult:
        """Execute monitoring using specific strategy."""
        # Implementation details
```

### 3. Factory Pattern for Monitoring Components
```python
class MonitoringFactory:
    """Factory for creating monitoring components."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_monitor(monitor_type: str) -> MonitoringComponent:
        """Create monitoring component based on type."""
        if monitor_type == "performance":
            return PerformanceMonitor()
        elif monitor_type == "health":
            return HealthMonitor()
        elif monitor_type == "metrics":
            return MetricsMonitor()
        # ... other monitor types
```
