Autonomous Development Competition System
=========================================

Gamification system to drive proactive autonomous agent development.
Balances healthy competition with cooperative swarm intelligence.

Based on Captain's insight: Competition drives proactive behavior essential
for autonomous development.

**V2 REFACTORED**: Split into modular components (C-055-4)
- system_core.py: Core competition logic
- achievements.py: Achievement tracking
- leaderboard.py: Leaderboard management
- competition_storage.py: Persistence
