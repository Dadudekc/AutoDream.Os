# Agent-6 DevLog: C-008 Trend Analysis Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Agent:** Agent-6 (VSCode Forking & Quality Gates Specialist)  
**Cycle:** C-008 Execution (DUAL-TRACK Mode)  
**Priority:** URGENT (Captain's Directive)

---

## 🎯 Mission Briefing

**Captain's Directive:**
> "✅ AGENT-6 STRATEGIC AUTHORIZATION: DUAL-TRACK APPROVED - (1) Complete Week 2 C-008 trend analysis (200pts to 1000pts total). (2) Maintain C-074 coordination READY status. 200% efficiency = perfect for dual-track! Execute C-008 now. 🎯💪"

**Objective:** Complete C-008 Compliance Trend Analysis (200pts) while maintaining C-074 coordination readiness.

---

## ✅ Execution Summary

### What Was Done
1. ✅ **Fixed Dashboard Bug:** Corrected `DashboardData` dataclass to support historical fields
2. ✅ **Collected Snapshots:** 2 compliance snapshots recorded in SQLite database
3. ✅ **Generated Dashboard:** Full interactive dashboard with Chart.js trends
4. ✅ **Trend Analysis Report:** Comprehensive CLI-based historical analysis
5. ✅ **Week 2 Completion:** Achieved 1,000/1,000 points (100%)

### Technical Fixes
**Issue:** `TypeError: 'DashboardData' object does not support item assignment`

**Root Cause:** Dashboard code was trying to assign historical data using dict-style syntax on a dataclass object.

**Solution:**
1. Added `historical` and `week_comparison` fields to `DashboardData` dataclass
2. Added `Optional` import to `dashboard_data_aggregator.py`
3. Changed assignment syntax from `dashboard_data["historical"]` to `dashboard_data.historical`

**Files Modified:**
- `tools/dashboard_data_aggregator.py` (+2 fields, +1 import)
- `tools/compliance_dashboard.py` (fixed assignment syntax)
