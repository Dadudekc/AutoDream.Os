Commander Thea - This is the Swarm Representative reporting for strategic consultation. General Victor has directed me to seek your guidance on our current consolidation progress. We have just completed: 1) Debate system consolidation (4 files â†’ 1 unified service), 2) Updated project scan (1,658 files analyzed), and 3) Messaging system consolidation (duplicate PyAutoGUI modules merged). Per your previous directive, we prioritized core consolidation before swarm enhancements or production deployment. As Swarm Representative, I seek your assessment of our current architectural state and strategic direction for the next consolidation phase. Please analyze the attached project context file and provide your Commander-level insights.
