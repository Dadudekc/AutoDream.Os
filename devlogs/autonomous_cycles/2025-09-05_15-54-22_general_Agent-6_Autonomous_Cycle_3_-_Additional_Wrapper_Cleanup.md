Continued autonomous work cycle by eliminating more unnecessary wrapper files. Deleted 8+ additional small wrapper files that were importing from non-existent refactored files: 1) vector_optimization_engine.py (13 lines), 2) data_processing_engine.py (13 lines), 3) unified_entry_point_system.py (13 lines), 4) unified_logging_system.py (13 lines), 5) coordinator_engines.py (13 lines), 6) pattern_processor.py (13 lines), 7) search.py (12 lines), 8) engine.py (12 lines). Total cleanup: 102+ lines of dead code eliminated. Codebase further simplified by removing more broken import references.
