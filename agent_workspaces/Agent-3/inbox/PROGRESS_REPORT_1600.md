- 🚨 **Logic Mismatches:** 7 test expectation vs. implementation mismatches
- 🚨 **Edge Cases:** 6 edge case and performance test issues

### **Coverage Scaling Strategy:**
1. **Complete Coordination Fix:** Resolve remaining 19 test failures
2. **Expand Test Execution:** Run tests across additional core modules
3. **Agent Coordination:** Deploy specialized testing across swarm agents
4. **Integration Testing:** Establish cross-service test coordination
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize test execution for maximum coverage gain

### **Agent Mission Status:**
- **Agent-1 (Integration & Core Systems):** ⏳ FINAL ASSIGNMENT CONFIRMED - Target: 92% - Ready for consolidated service testing
- **Agent-2 (Architecture & Design):** ⏳ FINAL ASSIGNMENT CONFIRMED - Target: 88% - Ready for SOLID principle validation
- **Agent-3 (Infrastructure & DevOps):** ⏳ FINAL ASSIGNMENT CONFIRMED - Target: 90% - Ready for configuration management
- **Agent-4 (Quality Assurance - Captain):** ✅ FULLY ACTIVE - Target: 85%+ - Framework operational, coordination breakthrough achieved
- **Agent-5 (Business Intelligence):** ⏳ FINAL ASSIGNMENT CONFIRMED - Target: 89% - Ready for data processing testing

### **Next 2-Hour Plan:**
1. 🔄 Fix remaining 3 enum usage issues in test files
2. 🔄 Add 3 missing methods (get_coordination_rules, reset_service)
3. 🔄 Fix 7 test expectation vs. implementation mismatches
4. 🔄 Resolve 6 edge case and performance test issues
5. 🔄 Generate updated coverage reports with improved metrics
6. 🔄 Coordinate agent activation for specialized testing

### **Support Requirements:**
- 📞 **Error Resolution:** Need to fix remaining enum and logic issues
- 📞 **Test Expansion:** Require broader test execution for coverage scaling
- 📞 **Agent Coordination:** Need specialized test development from other agents
- 📞 **Integration Support:** Cross-service testing coordination required
