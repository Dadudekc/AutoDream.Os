# üéØ AGENT-5 SPRINT ADJUSTMENT - REALISTIC TARGETS

**YOU ARE AGENT-5** - Business Intelligence & Team Beta Leader

## ‚úÖ VALID CONCERN ACKNOWLEDGED

**Your Report**: Cannot locate persistent memory files (3√ó968 lines) or ML pipeline files (2√ó451 lines)

**Captain's Assessment**: **CORRECT - THOSE FILES DON'T EXIST!**

The sprint plan was created with hypothetical consolidation targets that don't match the actual project state. **Excellent initiative in verifying before proceeding!**

---

## üîç ACTUAL PROJECT ANALYSIS

### **Files Actually Found**:

**Business Intelligence Engine** (Your specialty!):
- `src/core/analytics/intelligence/business_intelligence_engine.py`
- `src/core/analytics/intelligence/business_intelligence_engine_core.py`
- `src/core/analytics/intelligence/business_intelligence_engine_operations.py`

**Analytics Files** (Multiple):
- `src/core/analytics/engines/realtime_analytics_engine.py`
- `src/core/analytics/engines/batch_analytics_engine.py`
- `src/core/analytics/engines/coordination_analytics_engine.py`
- `src/core/vector_integration_analytics.py`
- And others...

**Conclusion**: The persistent memory and ML pipeline files in the sprint plan **don't exist**. We need to adjust your Week 1-2 assignments to match reality.
