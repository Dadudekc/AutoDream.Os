# 🎯 AGENT-2 SURVEY ASSIGNMENT
## Core Architecture Domain Survey

**Agent:** Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)
**Domain:** `src/core/` directory
**Deadline:** Discord Devlog Post by EOD Tomorrow
**Deliverable:** "Agent-2 Core Architecture Survey Results"

---

## 📋 YOUR MISSION

Conduct a comprehensive architectural survey of the `src/core/` directory to establish our baseline before the 683→250 file consolidation begins.

---

## 🔍 SURVEY REQUIREMENTS

### **1. Architectural Inventory**
**File:** `src/core/` directory
**Focus Areas:**
- Core architectural patterns and design decisions
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Integration points and dependencies
- Configuration management systems
- SOLID principle compliance assessment
- Anti-pattern identification
- Current consolidation progress in core
- Architectural technical debt analysis

### **2. Detailed Analysis Required:**

#### **Core Components Assessment:**
```python
# Analyze these key areas:
- src/core/unified_config.py          # Configuration management
- src/core/constants/                 # System constants and enums
- src/core/models/                    # Data models and structures
- src/core/services/                  # Core business logic
- src/core/validation/                # Validation systems
- src/core/coordination/              # Inter-system coordination
```

#### **SOLID Principles Audit:**
- **S (SRP):** Single Responsibility violations
- **O (OCP):** Open/Closed Principle compliance
- **L (LSP):** Liskov Substitution Principle adherence
- **I (ISP):** Interface Segregation analysis
- **D (DIP):** Dependency Inversion patterns

#### **Anti-Pattern Detection:**
- God Object classes
- Circular dependencies
- Tight coupling issues
- Configuration scattering
- Utility function duplication
