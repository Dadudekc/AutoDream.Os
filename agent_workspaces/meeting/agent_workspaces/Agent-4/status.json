CRITICAL PROTOCOL: Captain must be processed LAST in onboarding sequence for proper system initialization. UPDATED: Onboarding protocols now include task continuity preservation, accurate stall detection, and direct inbox communication channels to prevent work context loss and false stall warnings.",
