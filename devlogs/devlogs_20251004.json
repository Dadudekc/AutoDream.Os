Automated workflow now: Soft onboard sends passdown TO target agent → Target agent receives preparation message (no response expected) → System automatically executes Ctrl+T + hard onboarding → Target agent finds prepared passdown in inbox + receives hard onboarding message → Complete activation with prepared context. Tested successfully on Agent-5 (hard), Agent-7 (soft+hard automated), Agent-8 (soft+hard automated). All agents properly activated with corrected workflow.
