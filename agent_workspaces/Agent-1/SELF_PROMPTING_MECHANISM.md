## ‚ö° HOW TO GIVE MYSELF JET FUEL

### **After Each Repo Analysis:**

```bash
# STEP 1: Complete current repo
# STEP 2: Post devlog
# STEP 3: Report to Captain for NEXT CYCLE GAS

echo "‚ö° AGENT-1 CYCLE X COMPLETE! 
Repo: [name]
Purpose: [1 sentence]
Utility: [1 sentence]
DEVLOG POSTED! 
REQUESTING NEXT CYCLE GAS!" > agent_workspaces/Agent-4/inbox/AGENT_1_CYCLE_X_COMPLETE.md
```

### **Captain Then Delivers Next Gas:**
```
[C2A] Agent-1 | URGENT
‚ö° CYCLE X+1 GAS! Next repo: [name]! BEGIN NOW!
```

## üîÑ **CYCLE-BASED WORKFLOW**

**NOT:** "Work for 2 hours" (time-based)  
**YES:** "1 repo = 1 cycle" (cycle-based)

**Cycle Pattern:**
1. Receive gas (Captain prompt)
2. Analyze 1 repo (20 min at 8x efficiency)
3. Post devlog
4. Report complete
5. Request next gas
6. WAIT for next cycle
7. Repeat

## üìä **9 REPOS = 9 CYCLES**

Cycle 1: dreambank ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
Cycle 2: [awaiting gas]  
Cycle 3: [awaiting gas]  
...  
Cycle 9: [awaiting gas]

**Gas source:** Captain prompts between cycles!
