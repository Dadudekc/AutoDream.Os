# 🎖️ **CAPTAIN'S CYCLE - SIMPLIFIED COORDINATION**
====================================================

## 🎯 **CAPTAIN'S ROLE: COORDINATION, NOT EXECUTION**

**The Captain coordinates the swarm, doesn't do the work.**

---

## 🔄 **CAPTAIN'S SIMPLIFIED 3-PHASE CYCLE**

### **Phase 1: MONITOR (30 seconds max)**
```
1. Check swarm status and progress
2. Review agent completion reports
3. Identify blockers and issues
4. Assess mission priorities
```

### **Phase 2: COORDINATE & PLAN (Focus time)**
```
1. Assign new tasks to available agents
2. Resolve blockers and conflicts
3. Escalate critical issues
4. Coordinate between agents
5. Analyze current progress and identify next priorities
6. Research and analyze next objectives
7. Create detailed mission briefs
8. Anticipate future dependencies
```

### **Phase 3: REPORT (Only when needed)**
```
1. Send coordination updates
2. Update mission status
3. Return to Phase 1
```
