## 🎯 **SSOT Principles - Why Devlog is Mandatory**

### **The Problem Before Devlog:**
- ❌ **Scattered Updates**: Information spread across Discord, emails, chats
- ❌ **Lost Knowledge**: Important updates buried in conversation history
- ❌ **Team Confusion**: No one knows what others are working on
- ❌ **Duplicate Work**: Multiple agents working on same problems
- ❌ **No History**: Can't track progress or learn from past decisions

### **The Solution with Devlog:**
- ✅ **Single Source**: All updates in one searchable system
- ✅ **Preserved Knowledge**: Every update stored and retrievable
- ✅ **Team Awareness**: Everyone sees all project updates
- ✅ **Eliminated Duplication**: Clear visibility prevents overlap
- ✅ **Complete History**: Full project timeline and decision log

### **SSOT Rule**: 
**"If it's not in devlog, it doesn't exist for the team."**

## 🛠️ **Devlog Tool - How to Use It**

### **Quick Start (Recommended for Daily Use):**

```bash
# Basic project update
python scripts/devlog.py "Your Title" "Your content here"

# With specific agent and category
python scripts/devlog.py "Bug Found" "Issue with routing system" --agent "agent-2" --category "issue"

# High priority milestone
python scripts/devlog.py "Major Breakthrough" "AI module now fully functional" --priority "high" --category "milestone"
```

### **Full CLI (Advanced Users):**

```bash
# Create detailed entry
python -m src.core.devlog_cli create \
  --title "Your Title" \
  --content "Your content here" \
  --agent "your-agent-id" \
  --category "project_update" \
  --priority "normal"

# Search for information
python -m src.core.devlog_cli search --query "search term"

# Show recent updates
python -m src.core.devlog_cli recent --limit 5

# Check system status
python -m src.core.devlog_cli status
```

## 📱 **Discord Integration - Automatic Team Communication**

### **How It Works:**
1. **You create devlog entry** using the tool
2. **System automatically posts to Discord** via webhook
3. **Team sees update immediately** in Discord channel
4. **No manual Discord posting needed** - it's automatic!

### **Discord Message Format:**
```
📝 **DEVLOG ENTRY: [Your Title]**
🏷️ **Category**: [category]
🤖 **Agent**: [your-agent-id]
📅 **Created**: [timestamp]
📊 **Priority**: [priority]

📋 **Content**:
[Your content here]

🏷️ **Tags**: [tags]
🆔 **Entry ID**: [entry-id]
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Instant Team Notification** - Everyone sees updates immediately
- ✅ **Rich Formatting** - Professional-looking Discord embeds
- ✅ **Agent Identification** - Clear who posted what
- ✅ **Searchable History** - Can find any past update
- ✅ **No Manual Work** - Create once, appears everywhere

- **When**: Daily progress, feature completion, system status
- **Examples**: 
  - "Database optimization complete - 40% performance improvement"
  - "User authentication system deployed successfully"
  - "API endpoint testing completed"

### **milestone**
- **When**: Major achievements, phase completions, releases
- **Examples**:
  - "Phase 1 consolidation complete - ready for Phase 2"
  - "Version 2.0 released to production"
  - "Core architecture refactoring finished"

### **issue**
- **When**: Bugs, problems, blockers, technical debt
- **Examples**:
  - "Memory leak detected in performance monitoring"
  - "Database connection timeout under high load"
  - "API rate limiting causing user complaints"

### **idea**
- **When**: Suggestions, improvements, future enhancements
- **Examples**:
  - "Consider implementing caching layer for API responses"
  - "Add automated testing for new features"
  - "Implement real-time notifications system"

### **review**
- **When**: Code reviews, architecture reviews, security assessments

## 📋 **Content Standards - What Makes Good Devlog Entries**

### **✅ Good Content:**
- **Clear Title**: "Database Performance Optimization Complete"
- **Actionable Content**: "Reduced query time from 2.5s to 0.3s by adding indexes"
- **Specific Details**: "Added composite index on (user_id, created_at) columns"
- **Impact Statement**: "This improves user experience for large datasets"
- **Next Steps**: "Monitor performance for next 24 hours"

### **❌ Poor Content:**
- **Vague Title**: "Fixed some stuff"
- **Unclear Content**: "Made it work better"
- **No Details**: "Improved performance"
- **No Impact**: "It's faster now"
- **No Follow-up**: "Done"

### **Content Template:**
```
[What was accomplished]
[How it was done - technical details]
[Impact on the system/users]
[Next steps or monitoring needed]
```

## 🔍 **Search & Retrieval - Finding Information**

### **Search Commands:**
```bash
# Search by keyword
python -m src.core.devlog_cli search --query "database"

# Search by agent
python -m src.core.devlog_cli search --query "agent-1"

# Search by category
python -m src.core.devlog_cli search --query "performance" --category "milestone"

# Search with limit
python -m src.core.devlog_cli search --query "bug" --limit 20
```

### **Search Tips:**
- **Use Specific Terms**: "database" not "db stuff"
- **Search by Agent**: Find all updates from specific team member
- **Category Filtering**: Narrow results by type of update
- **Recent First**: Use `recent` command for latest updates
- **Full Text Search**: Searches both titles and content
