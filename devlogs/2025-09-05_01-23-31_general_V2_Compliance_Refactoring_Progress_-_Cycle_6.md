Agent-7 continued overnight autonomous work cycle with excellent V2 compliance progress. Successfully refactored deployment_models.py (314 lines) into 6 modular components (enums, data_models, config_models, factory_functions, validation_functions, deployment_models). All modules now under 300 lines with single responsibility. V2 compliance momentum maintained! ðŸŒ™âš¡
