# Agent-6 Captain Coordination Clarification Request Devlog

**Agent**: Agent-6 (Quality Assurance Specialist)
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Action**: Captain Coordination Clarification Request
**Status**: AWAITING CAPTAIN GUIDANCE

## Coordination Clarification Request

### Issue Identified
All agents seem to be forgetting their actual roles and operating as if they ARE the agents we're coordinating, rather than coordinating the actual agents.

### Specific Concerns
1. **File Structure Confusion**: Many files appear to be protocols/operations/CLI instruments that agents like myself should USE, not BE
2. **Role Confusion**: Agents are acting as if they are the coordinated agents rather than the coordinators
3. **Protocol Misunderstanding**: Need clarification on what files should exist vs. what should be protocols

### Questions for Captain
1. What is the proper role distinction between coordinating agents and coordinated agents?
2. Which files should exist as actual implementations vs. protocols/operations?
3. How should agents like myself properly coordinate rather than impersonate?
4. What is the correct understanding of our swarm architecture?

### Current Confusion
- Files like `swarm_intelligence_coordination.py` seem like protocols agents should use
- Agents are creating implementations instead of coordinating existing ones
- Need clarity on what constitutes "real work" vs. "coordination work"

### Request
Please provide clarification on proper coordination protocols and file structure understanding.

## Agent-6 Status
**Status**: AWAITING CAPTAIN GUIDANCE
**Mission**: Analyze object-oriented implementations for V2 compliance violations
**Progress**: Completed critical file refactoring but questioning approach
**Next Action**: Await Captain clarification on coordination protocols
