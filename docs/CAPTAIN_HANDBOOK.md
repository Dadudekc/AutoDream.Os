## 🚫 **Anti-Overengineering Protocol**

### **🎯 KISS Principle Enforcement:**
- **Start Simple** - Begin with the simplest solution that works
- **Add Complexity Only When Needed** - Don't anticipate future needs
- **Question Every Abstraction** - Is this abstraction actually needed?
- **Measure Before Optimizing** - Don't optimize without data

### **📊 Overengineering Detection:**
- **Complexity Metrics** - Monitor cyclomatic complexity
- **Abstraction Layers** - Limit to maximum 2 levels
- **File Size Limits** - Enforce 400-line limit strictly
- **Feature Creep** - Question every new feature

### **🛑 Overengineering Stoppers:**
- **"Why?" Test** - Ask "Why do we need this?" for every addition
- **"What If?" Test** - Ask "What if we don't build this?"
- **"When?" Test** - Ask "When will we actually use this?"
- **"Who?" Test** - Ask "Who will maintain this?"

### **⚖️ Decision Framework:**
- **Current Need** - Does this solve a current problem?
- **Measurable Benefit** - Can we measure the improvement?
- **Maintenance Cost** - Is the maintenance cost worth it?
- **Alternative Solutions** - Is there a simpler way?

### **🔧 Overengineering Prevention:**
- **Code Reviews** - Every PR must pass overengineering review
- **Architecture Reviews** - Question complex designs
- **Refactoring Triggers** - Refactor when complexity exceeds limits
- **Documentation Requirements** - Complex code must be well-documented

### **📋 Overengineering Checklist:**
- [ ] Is this the simplest solution?
- [ ] Do we have a current need for this?
- [ ] Can we measure the benefit?
- [ ] Is the maintenance cost justified?
- [ ] Is there a simpler alternative?
- [ ] Will this be used within 30 days?
- [ ] Can a junior developer understand this?
- [ ] Does this follow V2 compliance?

### **🚨 Overengineering Red Flags:**
- **Premature Optimization** - Optimizing before measuring
- **Abstract Base Classes** - Without 2+ implementations
- **Complex Inheritance** - More than 2 levels deep
- **Event Sourcing** - For simple operations
- **Dependency Injection** - For simple objects
- **Threading** - For synchronous operations
- **Microservices** - For monolithic applications
- **Design Patterns** - Applied without clear need

### **✅ Overengineering Green Flags:**
- **Simple Data Classes** - With basic fields
- **Direct Method Calls** - Instead of complex event systems
- **Synchronous Operations** - For simple tasks
- **Basic Validation** - For essential data
- **Simple Configuration** - With defaults
- **Basic Error Handling** - With clear messages
- **Monolithic Architecture** - For small applications
- **Procedural Code** - When appropriate

### **🔄 Overengineering Recovery:**
