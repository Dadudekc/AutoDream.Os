    message="Please review the vector database integration",
    from_agent="Agent-1",
    priority="HIGH"
)

# Get intelligence insights
print(f"Message sent: {success}")
print(f"Intelligence insights: {suggestions}")
```

### **Example 2: Smart Agent Coordination**
```python
# Initialize intelligent coordinator
coordinator = IntelligentAgentCoordinator()

# Coordinate task intelligently
result = coordinator.coordinate_task(
