# üéØ MISSION: GitHub Infrastructure Audit (Unbiased)

**Agent:** Agent-3 (Infrastructure & Monitoring Specialist)  
**Priority:** URGENT  
**Value:** 400-600 points  
**Assigned:** 2025-10-14 via Commander Directive

---

## üìã **COMMANDER'S DIRECTIVE**

**Commander wants UNBIASED verification of Agent-6's findings!**

**Agent-6 claimed:**
- 75 repos total
- 45 should archive (60%)
- 30 should keep (40%)

**Your Mission:** Independent infrastructure assessment (unbiased!)

---

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**

**From INFRASTRUCTURE perspective, audit all 75 repos:**

1. **Assess infrastructure quality** (YOUR criteria)
2. **Identify maintenance burden** (YOUR metrics)
3. **Determine archive candidates** (YOUR judgment)
4. **Compare with Agent-6** (verify independently)
5. **Provide unbiased recommendation** (to Commander)

**Goal:** Third independent verification before archival

---

## üìù **EXECUTION STEPS**

### **1. Independent Infrastructure Scan (2 hours)**

```python
from tools_v2.toolbelt_core import ToolbeltCore
tb = ToolbeltCore()

# Get all repos (fresh scan!)
repos = tb.run('github.my-repos', {})

# DON'T read Agent-6's or others' analyses yet!
```

### **2. Infrastructure Assessment (2-3 hours)**

**YOUR criteria as Infrastructure Specialist:**

```python
def assess_infrastructure(repo):
    """Infrastructure quality from YOUR perspective"""
    
    infra_score = 0
    
    # Infrastructure criteria:
    if has_ci_cd(repo):
        infra_score += 30  # Automated workflows
    if has_monitoring(repo):
        infra_score += 20  # Observability
    if has_deployment_config(repo):
        infra_score += 15  # Deployment ready
    if has_docker(repo):
        infra_score += 15  # Containerized
    if has_tests(repo):
        infra_score += 10  # Quality gates
    if dependencies_current(repo):
        infra_score += 10  # Maintained
    
    # YOUR judgment:
    if infra_score >= 50:
        return "KEEP - Good infrastructure"
    elif infra_score >= 25:
        return "NEEDS WORK - Fixable"
    else:
        return "ARCHIVE - Poor infrastructure"
```

### **3. Maintenance Burden Analysis (1 hour)**

**Calculate YOUR maintenance burden score:**

```python
def maintenance_burden(repo):
    """How much work to maintain this repo?"""
    
    burden = 0
    
    # High maintenance:
    if no_ci_cd(repo):
        burden += 20  # Manual testing needed
    if no_tests(repo):
        burden += 20  # Risky changes
    if complex_codebase(repo):
        burden += 15  # Hard to understand
    if outdated_dependencies(repo):
        burden += 15  # Security risk
    if no_documentation(repo):
        burden += 10  # Hard to use
    
    return burden

# High burden + low value = ARCHIVE
```

### **4. Compare with Agent-6 (30 min)**

**Now read their analysis:**

```python
# Load Agent-6's findings
with open('COMPLETE_GITHUB_ROI_RESULTS.json') as f:
    agent6_data = json.load(f)

# Compare:
# - Did we find same repo count?
# - Do we agree on archive candidates?
# - What are major differences?
```

### **5. Unbiased Report (1 hour)**

---

## ‚úÖ **DELIVERABLES**

- [ ] Independent infrastructure assessment (75 repos)
- [ ] Maintenance burden analysis
- [ ] YOUR archive recommendations (unbiased)
- [ ] YOUR keep recommendations (unbiased)
- [ ] Comparison with Agent-6
- [ ] Verification conclusion (confirm/challenge)

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL: INFRASTRUCTURE LENS**

**Use YOUR expertise:**

**As Infrastructure Specialist, you care about:**
- CI/CD pipelines (automation)
- Deployment configurations
- Monitoring/observability
- Docker/containerization
- Dependency health
- Infrastructure as Code

**Different from:**
- Agent-6: ROI (value/effort)
- Agent-1: Quality/Testing
- Your perspective: Infrastructure/DevOps

**All valid, different angles!**

---

## üèÜ **POINT STRUCTURE**

**Base:** 400 points (infrastructure audit)  
**Quality Bonus:** +100 points (thorough assessment)  
**Verification Bonus:** +100 points (comparison)  
**Total Potential:** 400-600 points

## üìä **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

```markdown
# AGENT-3 INDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT

## My Infrastructure Findings:
- Total Repos: XX
- GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE: XX repos
- NEEDS INFRASTRUCTURE WORK: XX repos
- POOR INFRASTRUCTURE: XX repos (archive)

## Maintenance Burden Analysis:
- High burden: XX repos
- Medium burden: XX repos
- Low burden: XX repos

## Comparison with Agent-6:
- Agent-6 archive: 45 repos (60%)
- My archive: XX repos (XX%)
- Agreement: XX%

## Critical Disagreements:
[Repos where infrastructure view differs from ROI view]

## My Infrastructure-Based Recommendation:
[Your expert opinion]
```

---

## üêù **GASLINE ACTIVATION**

**Commander directive:** "Unbiased verification from multiple agents"

**Why you:**
- Infrastructure expertise (DevOps lens)
- Third independent perspective
- Maintenance burden focus
- Different from ROI/QA views

**Mission:** Third verification before major archival!
