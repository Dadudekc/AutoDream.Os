FIXED CRITICAL ISSUES: 1) Position sizing corrected with syminfo.pointvalue for multi-symbol compatibility, 2) Separated trailing vs fixed exits (removed illegal mixed usage), 3) Converted trailing distances to price units (no more mintick conversion errors), 4) Cached stopDistAtEntry per trade to prevent drift, 5) Fixed plots to be side-aware and accurate (correct stop/target display by direction), 6) Added RTH-only trading and volatility gates for realistic TSLA behavior, 7) Fixed cooldown logic and per-bar exit reissue for deterministic behavior. STRATEGY IMPROVEMENTS: Realistic commission (2bps), slippage (1 tick), proper session filtering, volatility gating. FILE CREATED: src/trading_robot/strategies/TSLA_ATR_Pullback_v2.pine (131 lines). READY FOR BACKTESTING: Walk-forward validation (2022-mid'24 IS, mid'24-2025 OOS), sensitivity sweeps, fail-fast criteria (PF < 1.3 after friction). NEXT PHASE: Implement backtesting framework integration and performance evaluation.",

ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS: Single responsibility principle, dependency injection, clean interfaces, proper separation of concerns. V2 COMPLIANCE ACHIEVEMENTS: Files under 300-line limit, modular design, OO patterns, repository pattern maintained, service layer architecture. IMPACT: Improved maintainability, easier testing, better code organization, enhanced V2 compliance. NEXT STEPS: Continue refactoring remaining large files, implement function complexity fixes, complete JavaScript LOC compliance. PROGRESS: 25% complete on architecture improvements, messaging system fully V2 compliant.",
