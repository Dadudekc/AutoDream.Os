"""
Advanced Workflow Package - V2 Compliant Refactored Structure

This package contains the refactored advanced workflow engine components,
each following V2 standards (â‰¤300 LOC) and Single Responsibility Principle.

Components:
- workflow_types.py: Type definitions and enums
- workflow_core.py: Core workflow logic and data models
- workflow_validation.py: Validation logic and error handling
- workflow_cli.py: CLI interface for testing and management

Note: For workflow execution, use the modular workflow system:
- src.core.workflow.workflow_execution.WorkflowExecutionEngine
