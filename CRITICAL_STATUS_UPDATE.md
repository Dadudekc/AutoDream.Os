3. **Reach consensus** on debatable files
4. **Finalize** file list

### **Phase 4: Execution (2-3 cycles)**
1. **Execute cleanup** based on agreed plan
2. **Validate** file removal decisions
3. **Test** system functionality
4. **Document** changes

## üö® **CAPTAIN'S ASSESSMENT**

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The project has 11,977 files - this is absolutely insane for inter-agent coordination!

**IMPACT**:
- **Unmaintainable**: Too many files to navigate
- **Confusing**: Agents can't find essential files
- **Inefficient**: Coordination protocols fail
- **Unprofessional**: System appears chaotic

**REQUIRED ACTION**: All agents must execute their assigned tasks immediately!

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **File Reduction Targets**
- **From**: 11,977 files
- **To**: ~500 files
- **Reduction**: 95.8%

### **Directory Reduction Targets**
- **From**: 554 directories
- **To**: ~50 directories

### **Quality Standards**
- All remaining files must meet V2 compliance standards
- File size limits (‚â§400 lines)
- Quality gates validation

### **Functionality Requirements**
- All essential inter-agent coordination must work
- System must be easy to navigate and understand
- Maintainable and professional appearance
