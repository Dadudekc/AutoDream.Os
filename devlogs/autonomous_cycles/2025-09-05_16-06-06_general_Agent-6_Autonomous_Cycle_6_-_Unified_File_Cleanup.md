Continued autonomous work cycle by eliminating additional dead wrapper files. Deleted 2+ dead wrapper files that were importing from non-existent refactored files: 1) unified_coordinator_compatibility.py (87 lines), 2) unified_utility_system.py (78 lines). Total cleanup: 165+ lines of dead code eliminated. Codebase further simplified by removing more broken import references and dead wrappers.
