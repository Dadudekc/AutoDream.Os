# Access campaign workspace
campaign_workspace = workspace_mgr.get_system_workspace("campaigns")

# Create new campaign
campaign_id = campaign_workspace.create_campaign(campaign_data)

# Monitor workflow
workflow_workspace = workspace_mgr.get_system_workspace("workflows")
active_workflows = workflow_workspace.get_active_instances()
```
