## 🎯 **BLOCKING ISSUE DOCUMENTATION**

### **Technical Details:**

**Issue:** Jest/VSCode mock configuration for extension testing

**Problem:**
- Phase 2 tests require VSCode API mocks
- Jest needs proper configuration to run in VSCode extension context
- Mock setup more complex than anticipated

**What's Needed:**
1. Jest configuration for VSCode extension testing
2. VSCode API mocks properly set up
3. Test runner configured for extension environment
4. Possibly @vscode/test-electron integration

**Complexity:** High (not a simple fix)

**Recommendation:** Fresh session with focused time on mock configuration

---

## 🚀 **NEXT SESSION PLAN**

### **Phase 2 Completion Steps:**

**Step 1: Mock Configuration (Priority)**
- Configure Jest for VSCode extensions
- Set up VSCode API mocks
- Test runner integration
- Estimated: 30-60 minutes focused work

**Step 2: Run Phase 2 Tests**
- Execute 16 written tests
- Verify all passing
- Debug any failures

**Step 3: Complete Test Suite (if needed)**
- Add any missing tests to reach ~27 total
- E2E tests if not yet written
- 85%+ coverage validation

**Step 4: Agent-8 Final QA**
- Request validation
- Gold standard confirmation
- Phase 2 COMPLETE

**Estimated:** 1-2 hours in fresh session
