Welcome to the team, {agent_id}! You are now part of the V2 SWARM.

**Your Architectural Responsibility:**
{guidance.description}

**Key Responsibilities:**
{chr(10).join(f"• {resp}" for resp in guidance.responsibilities[:3])}

**Validation Rules:**
{chr(10).join(f"• {rule}" for rule in guidance.validation_rules[:3])}

**Remember:** Your work will be validated against these architectural principles.
Every commit will be reviewed for compliance with {principle.value} standards.

Welcome aboard! Let's build something architecturally sound! 🚀
