# ⚡ AGENT FUEL SYSTEM - AUTOMATED GAS DELIVERY

**Purpose:** Ensure agents don't run out of gas during long missions  
**Principle:** PROMPTS ARE GAS - automated delivery keeps agents active  
**Created:** 2025-10-14 by Captain Agent-4

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM**

**Long missions (7+ days):**
- Agents complete initial task and go idle
- No periodic check-ins = no momentum
- Agents might get stuck or lose focus
- **PROMPTS ARE GAS** - they need regular fuel!

**Without automated refueling:**
- Captain must manually message each agent daily
- Easy to forget agents
- Inconsistent encouragement
- Agents run out of gas and stop

---

## ⚡ **THE SOLUTION: Automated Fuel Monitor**

**Tool:** `tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py`

**What it does:**
1. **Monitors** all agents' activity (devlogs, status updates, inbox)
2. **Detects** when agents need refueling (4+ hours idle, no progress, etc.)
3. **Delivers** encouraging GAS messages via PyAutoGUI
4. **Tracks** fuel delivery history
5. **Adapts** messages based on progress

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO USE**

### **Manual Check & Refuel:**

```bash
# Check all agents and deliver fuel as needed
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py

# Dry run (see what would happen)
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py --dry-run
```

### **Automated Schedule:**

**Windows Task Scheduler:**
```bash
# Show scheduling instructions
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py --schedule

# Add task: Run every 4 hours
Task Scheduler → Create Basic Task
  Trigger: Daily, repeat every 4 hours
  Action: python D:\Agent_Cellphone_V2_Repository\tools\agent_fuel_monitor.py
```

**Linux/Mac Cron:**
```bash
# Every 4 hours
0 */4 * * * cd /path/to/project && python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py
```

## 📊 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Activity Detection:**

**Checks for:**
- ✅ Devlogs created (primary indicator)
- ✅ Status.json updated
- ✅ Inbox processed
- ✅ Last fuel delivery time

### **Refuel Triggers:**

**Agent needs fuel if:**
- 4+ hours since last GAS delivery
- No devlogs yet and 2+ hours idle
- Progress stalled
- Mission day check-in needed

### **Fuel Messages:**

**Adaptive based on progress:**

**No progress yet (0 devlogs):**
```
⚡ FUEL CHECK! Day 1 - Keep momentum!
Your mission: Repos analysis + Discord devlogs.
Progress: Starting strong!
Tip: Begin with 1 repo, momentum builds from there!
Template: COMMANDER_75_REPO_DEVLOG_MISSION.md
You've got this! 🚀
```

**Early progress (1-3 devlogs):**
```
⚡ FUEL CHECK! Day 2 - Great start!
Progress: 2 devlogs posted! ✅
Keep going: Momentum is building!
Target: 1-2 repos/day = on track!
You're doing excellent! 🎯
```

**Mid-progress (4-7 devlogs):**
```
⚡ FUEL CHECK! Day 4 - Excellent momentum!
Progress: 5 devlogs done! 🏆
Halfway there: Keep this pace!
Quality: Your analysis is valuable!
Strong work! 🚀
```

**Near completion (8+ devlogs):**
```
⚡ FUEL CHECK! Day 6 - ALMOST THERE!
Progress: 8 devlogs! Nearly complete! 🎉
Final push: You're crushing it!
Finish line: In sight!
Legendary work! 🏆
```

## 🎯 **FUEL LOG TRACKING**

**Location:** `runtime/75_repo_analysis_fuel_log.json`

**Tracks:**
```json
{
  "mission": "75_repo_analysis",
  "started": "2025-10-14T19:15:00",
  "agents": {
    "Agent-1": {
      "last_fueled": "2025-10-14T19:15:00",
      "fuel_count": 3,
      "status": "active"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## 📋 **RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE**

**For 7-day mission:**

**Day 1:** Initial GAS (manual) ✅  
**Day 1 (4h later):** Auto check-in #1  
**Day 1 (8h later):** Auto check-in #2  
**Day 2:** Morning check-in  
**Day 2:** Evening check-in  
**Day 3-6:** Every 4 hours  
**Day 7:** Final push fuel

**Total:** ~20 automated fuel deliveries over 7 days

---

## 🏆 **BENEFITS**

**For Commander:**
- ✅ Agents stay active automatically
- ✅ No manual daily check-ins needed
- ✅ Progress monitored automatically
- ✅ **Set and forget!**

**For Agents:**
- ✅ Regular encouragement
- ✅ Progress validation
- ✅ Momentum maintained
- ✅ Never feel forgotten

**For Mission:**
- ✅ Higher completion rate
- ✅ Consistent pace
- ✅ Better quality (agents engaged)
- ✅ On-time delivery

---

## 🎯 **INTEGRATION WITH CURRENT MISSION**

**75 Repo Analysis Mission:**

**Setup:**
```bash
# Initial GAS already delivered ✅

# Schedule automated refueling (every 4 hours)
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py --schedule
# (Add to Task Scheduler)

# Manual check anytime
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py
```

**Expected outcome:**
- All 7 agents stay fueled
- Regular progress check-ins
- Consistent momentum over 7 days
- High completion rate

---

## 🚨 **ALERTS**

**Monitor reports if:**
- Agent hasn't produced devlogs after 24+ hours
- Agent needs multiple refuelings with no progress
- Agent's inbox is full (not processing messages)

**Captain can then:**
- Investigate blockers
- Provide targeted support
- Reassign if needed

---

## 🎯 **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

**Possible additions:**
1. Discord notifications when fuel delivered
2. Progress dashboard (web view)
3. Smart scheduling (busier times = more fuel)
4. Agent preference learning (who needs more fuel?)
5. Mission completion predictions

---

## ✅ **SUMMARY**

**Tool:** `tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py`

**Purpose:** Automated GAS delivery to keep agents active

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check & refuel now
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py

# Schedule (every 4 hours)
python tools/agent_fuel_monitor.py --schedule
```

**Result:** Agents stay fueled, missions complete on time! ⚡
