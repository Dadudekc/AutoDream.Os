## 📋 **Issue Overview**

**Type**: `enhancement`  
**Priority**: `LOW`  
**Estimated Effort**: `1` hours  
**Difficulty**: `Easy`  
**Category**: `Test Suite Runner`

---

## 🎯 **Refactoring Goal**

**File**: `src/run_test_suite.py`  
**Current Lines**: `410` → **Target**: `400`  
**Reduction Target**: `2%%`

**Focus**: Coding Standards & SRP Compliance (LOC limits are guidelines, not strict requirements)

---

## 🔍 **Current Violations**

- Single Responsibility Principle violation
- Test suite logic mixed with runner logic
- Multiple test suite concerns in single class

---

## 🏗️ **Refactoring Plan**

**Extract Modules**:
- `suite_core.py`
- `runner_coordinator.py`
- `suite_interface.py`

**Main Class**: `Main class name`  
**Responsibilities**: Multiple responsibilities identified  
**Dependencies**: - src/
- src/utils/suite_helpers

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- File under 400 lines
- Each module has single responsibility
- All tests pass
- No functionality regression

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Analyze** current code structure and identify responsibilities
2. **Extract** focused modules following SRP
3. **Refactor** main class to orchestrate extracted modules
4. **Test** functionality remains intact
5. **Validate** coding standards compliance
6. **Update** documentation and dependencies

## 💡 **Tips for Contributors**

- **Focus on SRP**: Each module should have one reason to change
- **Maintain functionality**: Ensure refactoring doesn't break existing features
- **Follow patterns**: Use existing architecture where possible
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate all functionality after refactoring
- **Document changes**: Update docstrings and comments

## 📝 **Notes**

- This is part of the Phase 3 refactoring initiative
- Priority is on **coding standards compliance**, not strict LOC limits
- Focus on **architectural quality** and **maintainability**
- Use existing patterns and avoid code duplication
