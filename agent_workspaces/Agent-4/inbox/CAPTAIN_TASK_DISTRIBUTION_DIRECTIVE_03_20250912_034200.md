- **Dependency Analysis:** No conflicting assignments or prerequisites
- **Time Estimation Review:** Realistic deadlines based on complexity

##### **In-Progress Quality Monitoring:**
- **Code Review Standards:** Regular check-ins on work in progress
- **Documentation Compliance:** Examples must be executable and accurate
- **Testing Validation:** Tests must pass and cover edge cases
- **V2 Compliance Verification:** All code meets 400-line limit and standards

##### **Final Deliverable Quality Inspection:**
- **Automated Quality Checks:** Linting, formatting, type hints
- **Manual Code Review:** Logic, efficiency, and best practices
- **Documentation Review:** Completeness, accuracy, and usefulness
