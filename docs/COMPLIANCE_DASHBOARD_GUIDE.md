   - Average of V2 and complexity compliance rates
   
2. **Penalties** (50% weight):
   - CRITICAL violation: -5 points each
   - HIGH complexity: -2 points each

### **Score Interpretation**:

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | A | Excellent - production ready |
| 80-89 | B | Good - minor improvements needed |
| 70-79 | C | Acceptable - some work required |
| 60-69 | D | Needs improvement - prioritize fixes |
| 0-59 | F | Critical - immediate action required |
