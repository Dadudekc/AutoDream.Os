- Class size: 301 lines (max 200)
- Function `award_achievement`: 66 lines (max 30)

**Automated Refactoring Suggestion:**
- Confidence: 71%
- Suggested extraction: `autonomous_competition_system_helpers.py`
- Methods to extract: `_load_scores`, `_save_scores`, `_update_ranks`
- Estimated result: 393 lines (V2 COMPLIANT)

**Analysis:** Low confidence extraction of private methods. May require manual refactoring or exception consideration.

#### File #2: `src/core/managers/core_configuration_manager.py`
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR VIOLATION  
**Current:** 414 lines (exceeds 400-line limit)  
**Violations:**
- File size: 414 lines (MAJOR VIOLATION)
- 14 functions (max 10)
- Class size: 392 lines (max 200)
- Multiple functions >30 lines

**Automated Refactoring Suggestion:**
- Confidence: 79%
- Suggested extraction: `core_configuration_manager_helpers.py`
- Methods to extract: 6 helper methods (181 lines)
- Estimated result: 274 lines (V2 COMPLIANT)

**Analysis:** Higher confidence extraction. Good candidate for refactoring or exception approval.
